\section {Result and Discussion}
In this section, predictions only with the dynamically evaluated mixing model are shown in comparisons with the experiments. Note these flames with were studied previously \cite{Ge2011,Ge2013} with a different mixing model which is known to suppress conditional fluctuations. In the next section, we compare three variations of the anisotropic mixing time scale model, which gives a better estimate of the dissipation of minor scalar fluctuations \cite{Vo2017a}.

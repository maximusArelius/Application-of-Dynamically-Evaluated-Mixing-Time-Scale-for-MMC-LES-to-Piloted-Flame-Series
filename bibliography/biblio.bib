  abstract = {A consistent hybrid large-eddy simulation/filtered-density-function approach (LES-FDF) is formulated for variable-density low-Mach-number flows. The LES-FDF approach has been proposed as a suitable method for finite-rate-chemistry-based predictive modeling of turbulent reactive flows. Due to the large computational grid associated with LES, use of Lagrangian schemes is numerically expensive. In this work, a highly efficient parallel Lagrangian implementation is used for the simulation of a nonpremixed flame. This bluff-body-stabilized flame is characterized by complex flow fields that interact strongly with the combustion mechanism. A LES grid size of 1 million computational cells and roughly 15 million notional particles is used to simulate a time-accurate variable-density flow. The hybrid approach predicts the time-averaged velocity and root mean square (RMS) velocity components quite accurately. Species profiles including hydroxyl radical compare well with experimental data. Consistency and accuracy are established by comparing particle and Eulerian density, mixture fraction, and RMS mixture fraction fields. Scalar FDFs at select locations are shown to be well approximated by the presumed beta function used in typical combustion LES. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Combustion Institute.

  abstract = {The laminar flamelet concept views a turbulent diffusion flame as an ensemble of laminar diffusion flamelets. Work relevant to the flamelet concept is spread over various fields in the literature: laminar flame studies, asymptotic analysis, theory of turbulence and percolation theory. This review tries to gather and integrate this material in order to derive a self-consistent formulation. Under the assumption of equal diffusivities a coordinate-free formulation of the flamelet structure is given. This assumption is relaxed and flow dependent effects are considered. It is shown that the steady laminar counterflow diffusion flame exhibits a very similar scalar structure as unsteady distorted mixing layers in a turbulent flow field. Therefore the counterflow geometry is proposed to be the most representative steady flow field to study chemistry models and molecular transport effects in laminar flamelets. The conserved scalar model is interpreted as the most basic flamelet structure. Non-equilibrium calculations are reviewed. The coupling between non-equilibrium chemistry and turbulence is achieved by the statistical description of two parameters: the mixture fraction and the instantaneous scalar dissipation rate. The hypothesis of statistical independence of these two parameters is discussed. Calculation methods for the marginal distributions are reviewed. It is shown how local quenching of diffusion flamelets leads to a reduction of burnable flamelets. However, there are burnable flamelets in a turbulent flame which are not reached by an ignition source. This phenomenon is described by percolation theory. Complementary approaches related to local quenching effects and connectedness are combined to derive criteria for the stabilization of lifted flames and to blow out. Further applications of the flamelet concept are reviewed and work to be done is discussed.},

Comparisons of the predicted gas phase and droplet statistics with measurements show a good agreement confirming that the droplet dispersion and evaporation models used in this work are adequate.

@article{Varna2017a,
  abstract = {Probability density function (PDF) methods have significant advantages in modeling turbulent combustion, in particular because the highly non-linear chemical source terms appear in closed form. The micromixing term in the PDF transport equations, representing diffusion in composition space, is however unclosed. Physically, micromixing occurs between regions of fluid having similar compositions. It is expected and generally shown that models that account for this localness of mixing perform better. In this work, a novel variation of the multiple mapping conditioning (MMC) mixing model is proposed. MMC makes use of reference variables to localise the mixing and was originally formulated for stochastic reference variables with standard Gaussian distributions. Here we follow the original interpretation but modify it by using a reference variable that has an evolving distribution, according to an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, with statistics that are similar to those of a physical scalar. In the present application of the model to nonpremixed combustion, mixture fraction is considered as the scalar; extensions of the model may be envisaged for other combustion modes by considering a different scalar variable. While the original version of MMC is mathematically elegant, it is conceptually complex and evaluation of model coefficients is difficult. The new model is both physically intuitive and its coefficients are easy to determine according to desired principles in canonical mixing situations. In Part I of this two-paper set, the model is studied analytically for homogeneous and mean scalar gradient flows without chemical reaction leading to an approach to set the model parameters that controls the unconditional scalar dissipation rate and delivers tunable localness. The behaviour of the model is also examined numerically in simple homogeneous mixing situations with and without chemical reaction. In Part II, the new MMC mixing model is implemented in the RANS context and validated against experimental data for the Sandia D–F flame series.},

  abstract = {Large Eddy Simulation (LES) has shown great promise in the calculation of traditionally difficult turbulent cases, such as unsteady and recirculating flows and for aeroacoustic applications. Unfortunately, this added accuracy, (though much less expensive than Di- rect Numerical Simulations (DNS)) comes at a considerable computational cost increase when compared to the conventional Reynolds Average (RANS) approach. Although it is by no means the only factor leading to this increased cost, the way in which LES inter- acts with wall boundaries has been identified as the major contributor to this problem. In an attempt to address this issue, many turbulence researchers have investigated the requirements and effects of simplifying the aforementioned interaction, which has to date met with varying degrees of success. The current work aims to contribute to this effort, with the main goal of ascertaining whether LES can effectively be used in the near term to model aerodynamic flows of the type associated with automobiles. In addition to providing more accurate aerodynamic results, such a methodology should also allow the calculation of aero-acoustic noise for the problem under investigation. Large grid sizes necessitated by well resolved aerodynamic simulations of such high Reynolds number flows make them generally unfeasible given current CPU speeds. This project attempts to address this issue in two ways: firstly, through the application of approximate wall treatments and secondly through improved mesh distribution.},

@article{Dopazo1974,
  abstract = {This paper considers the turbulent homogeneous mixing of two reactants undergoing a one step, second order, irreversible, exothermic chemical reaction with a rate constant of the Arrhenius type. A statistically stationary turbulent velocity field is assumed given and unaffected by mass or heat production due to the chemical reaction. Relative density fluctuations are neglected. A Hopf-like functional formalism is presented, with application to both statistically inhomogeneous and statistically homogeneous flows. Single and double point probability density function differential equations are derived from those functional equations. The limit of very large activation energies is considered; a low degree of statistical correlation between temperature and concentration fields during the ignition period is hypothesized. After making use of the homogeneity assumption a closure problem is still present due to the nonlocalness of the molecular diffusion term. The problem is rendered closed by assuming a Gaussian conditional expected value for the temperature at a point given the temperature at a neighboring point. The closure is seen to preserve very important mathematical and physical properties. A linear first order hyperbolic differential equation with variable coefficients for the probability density function of the temperature field is obtained. A second Damk{\"{o}}hler number based on Taylor's microscale turns out to be an important controlling parameter. A numerical integration for different values of the second Damk{\"{o}}hler number and the initial stochastic parameters is carried out. The mixture is seen to evolve towards an eventual thermal runaway, the detailed behavior however being different for different systems. Some peculiarities during the ignition period evolution are uncovered.},

@article{Kaul2013,
  abstract = {Accurate prediction of nonpremixed turbulent combustion using large eddy simulation (LES) requires detailed modeling of the mixing between fuel and oxidizer at scales finer than the LES filter resolution. In conserved scalar combustion models, the small scale mixing process is quantified by two parameters, the subfilter scalar variance and the subfilter scalar dissipation rate. The most commonly used models for these quantities assume a local equilibrium exists between production and dissipation of variance. Such an assumption has limited validity in realistic, technically relevant flow configurations. However, nonequilibrium models for variance and dissipation rate typically contain a model coefficient whose optimal value is unknown a priori for a given simulation. Furthermore, conventional dynamic procedures are not useful for estimating the value of this coefficient. In this work, an alternative dynamic procedure based on the transport equation for subfilter scalar variance is presented. This dynamic nonequilibrium modeling approach is used for simulation of a turbulent lifted ethylene flame, previously studied using DNS by Yoo et al. (2011). The predictions of the new model are compared to those of a static nonequilibrium modeling approach using an assumed model coefficient, as well as those of the equilibrium modeling approach. The equilibrium models are found to systematically underpredict both subfilter scalar variance and dissipation rate. Use of the dynamic procedure is shown to increase the accuracy of the nonequilibrium modeling approach. However, numerical errors that arise as a consequence of grid-based implicit filtering appear to degrade the accuracy of all three modeling options. Thus, while these results confirm the usefulness of the new dynamic model, they also show that the quality of subfilter model predictions depends on several factors extrinsic to the formulation of the subfilter model itself. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Combustion Institute.},

Ogi, Fully conservative finite difference scheme in cylindrical coordinates for incompressible flow simulations, J. Comput. Phys. 197 (2004) 686] is extended to simulate variable density flows in complex geometries with cylindrical or cartesian non-uniform meshes. The formulation discretely conserves mass, momentum, and kinetic energy in a periodic domain. In the presence of walls, boundary conditions that ensure primary conservation have been derived, while secondary conservation is shown to remain satisfactory. In the case of cylindrical coordinates, it is desirable to increase the order of accuracy of the convective term in the radial direction, where most gradients are often found. A straightforward centerline treatment is employed, leading to good accuracy as well as satisfactory robustness. A similar strategy is introduced to increase the order of accuracy of the viscous terms. The overall numerical scheme obtained is highly suitable for the simulation of reactive turbulent flows in realistic geometries, for it combines arbitrarily high order of accuracy, discrete conservation of mass, momentum, and energy with consistent boundary conditions. This numerical methodology is used to simulate a series of canonical turbulent flows ranging from isotropic turbulence to a variable density round jet. Both direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES) results are presented. It is observed that higher order spatial accuracy can improve significantly the quality of the results. The error to cost ratio is analyzed in details for a few cases. The results suggest that high order schemes can be more computationally efficient than low order schemes.},

  abstract = {Spray combustion finds a wide range of application in gas turbines, internal combustion engines, industrial furnaces, etc. In turbulent spray combustion, liquid fuel is injected into the combustion chamber in the form of droplets. In order to improve the combustion efficiency and to reduce the thermal NOx emissions released during combustion, spray combustion could be operated in flameless mode. In a flameless combustion, the oxidizer is mixed with recirculated hot combustion gases to preheat and to dilute it. The dilution of oxidizer results in lower peak combustion temperature which reduces the NOx emissions and oxidizer preheating improves the thermal efficiency of combustion. In order to fully understand the combustion mechanics for its effective implementation in various applications, numerical simulations of flameless turbulent spray combustion are potentially useful because simulations are cost effective and serve as basis for further experimental studies based on the validation of numerical models. Turbulent spray combustion is a complex phenomenon involving two phases namely the gaseous phase and liquid phase. These two phases interact with each other through mass, momentum and energy transfer between them. This is complicated further by the interaction between the turbulence in the flow field and chemistry of the reacting species. Hence simplified models are necessary to simulate and understand the phenomenon of turbulent spray combustion. In this thesis, numerical validation study of turbulent ethanol spray flame using open-source software package OpenFOAM is carried out for the experiments done in Delft Spray-in-Hot-Coflow (DSHC) burner operated in flameless mode. The modeling approach used is Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes simulations (RANS) with Eulerian- Lagrangian framework for the continuous phase and discrete phase respectively. Models like evaporation and turbulence models used in the sprayFoam solver are optimized for the spray combustion and validated with experimental data for one flame. The evaporation models studied are Gradient diffusion model and Spalding model. It is found that Gradient diffusion model gives better prediction of droplet properties at higher axial locations than Spalding model. The standard and realizable k-$\epsilon$ model turbulence models comparative analysis showed that standard k-$\epsilon$ model has much better gas phase temperature prediction than realizable k-$\epsilon$ model due to the dependence of combustion model (Partially Stirred Reactor model) on the turbulence mixing frequency, $\epsilon$/k. These optimized models are extended to simulation of HI and HIII flames. The peak gas phase temperature was under- predicted by the PaSR model. The results showed the importance of analyzing the different initial spray conditions},

First, important physico-chemical features of combustion-LES are discussed along with several aspects of overall LES models. Subsequently, some numerical issues, in particular questions associated with the reliability of LES results, are outlined. The details of chemistry, its reduction, and tabulation are not addressed here. Second, two illustrative applications dealing with non-premixed and premixed flame configurations are presented. The results show that combustion-LES is able to provide predictions very close to measured data for configurations where the flow is governed by large turbulent structures. To meet the future demands, new key challenges in specific modelling areas are suggested, and opportunities for advancements in combustion-LES techniques are highlighted. From a predictive point of view, the main target must be to provide a reliable method to aid combustion safety studies and the design of combustion systems of practical importance.},

This book serves as both a graduate text and a reference for engineers and scientists exploring the theoretical and computational aspects of the fluid dynamics and transport of sprays and droplets. Attention is given to the behavior of individual droplets, including the effects of forced convection due to relative droplet–gas motion, Stefan convection due to the vaporization or condensation of the liquid, multicomponent liquids (and slurries), and internal circulation of the liquid. This second edition contains more information on droplet-droplet interactions, the use of the mass-flux potential, conserved scalar variables, spatial averaging and the formulation of the multi-continua equations, the confluence of spatial averaging for sprays and filtering for turbulence, direct numerical simulations and large-eddy simulations for turbulent sprays, and high-pressure vaporization processes. Two new chapters introduce liquid-film vaporization as an alternative to sprays for miniature applications and a review of liquid-stream distortion and break-up theory, which is relevant to spray formation.},

@article{Kramer2001,
  abstract = {1 Abstract We provide a brief overview of some Monte Carlo methods which have been used to simulate systems with a turbulent fluid component. We discuss two main classes of simulation approaches: an  Eulerian  class which is based on a random velocity field model defined on a fixed coordinate system, and a  Lagrangian  class in which the motion of fluid particles and immersed particles are instead stochastically modeled. The main aim of this article is to expose these novel simulation approaches to turbulent and complex fluid systems to a broader readership familiar with stochastic processes and to provide some pointers to the literature. 2 Introduction A continuing challenge is the numerical simulation of turbulent systems, in which the fluid is forced sufficiently vigorously so as to generate a disordered and unpredictable structure over a wide range of scales [47, 74]. The key difficulty is the inability for even large computers to resolve all of the active scales in systems with strong turbulence in a direct numerical simulation based on the fundamental Navier-Stokes equations [43, 54]. A numerical representation of turbulence, however, is crucial in computer simulation studies in many applied fields, ranging from atmosphere-ocean dynamics (including weather and climate prediction) [11, 43, 47], combustion [7, 33, 45, 62, 80, 85], turbulent diffusion [48], mixing processes and numerous other engineering situations [36, 54]. These applications do not require a turbulence simulation with full fidelity – only certain key features of the turbulence need to be represented. On the other hand, models which account for turbulence only through an enhanced diffusivity coefficient are often insufficient [43, 54, 77]. This is particularly the case in reaction and mixing processes where the fine-scale fluctuations in the immersed chemical species play an important role, and these are completely ignored in a crude eddy diffusion model and not well represented in large eddy simulations [33, 45]. Monte Carlo approaches are an attractive option for turbulence simulations due both to their capacity for investigating systems with many degrees of freedom and to their natural generation of a disordered velocity field structure and irregular particle trajectories. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of a deterministic mechanism for generating a velocity field with disordered fluctuations over a wide range of scales, other than by an expensive direct numerical simulation which resolves all those scales! Most recent methods which have been used to simulate turbulent systems can be classified into two categories. In the first, which we call the  Eulerian  fluid simulation approach, a velocity field is generated over a prescribed spatial domain, but by a direct stochastic construction 1},

  abstract = {Chirped-Probe-Pulse, femtosecond Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) spectroscopy of nitrogen has been shown effective in making high-speed (5 kHz) single-shot temperature measurements in both laminar and turbulent combustion environments. The chirped-probe pulse technique offers one of the shortest integration times of any laser diagnostic technique – appx. 3 ps, and excellent spatial resolution – appx. 1 mm along beam propagation and 75 m in the transverse dimension. This paper outlines the current work, applying this technique to the two-phase combustion environment in a liquid-fuel spray burner. The research collaboration presented here involves fs CPP CARS measurements in a dilute spray flame of ethanol. This paper presents results from two flame cases: one premixed methane-air flame and one ethanol dilute spray flame. Time-averaged temperature profiles as well as temperature time-histories are presented for both flames. Sources of measurement error are discussed relating to the interference of the methane signal with the nitrogen signal and relating to liquid droplets passing through the laser probe volume. The 5 kHz data acquisition rate was rapid enough to capture smoothly-varying temperature profiles for all but the most turbulent regions. The buildup and decay of temperature oscillatory structures was observed at the flame-coflow boundary in both flames and is discussed. Continuing research is aimed at the expansion of this data set into more complex spray flames of intermediate density.

Although direct numerical simulation (DNS) offers the potential to study the physical processes during primary atomization in detail, thereby supplementing experimental diagnostics, it also introduces severe numerical challenges. We outline these challenges and the numerical methods to address them, highlighting some recent efforts in performing detailed simulation of the primary atomization process. The second part is devoted to phenomenological models of primary atomization. Because earlier conventional models of breakup are well reported in the available literature, we highlight only two recent developments: (a) stochastic simulation of the liquid jet depletion in the framework of fragmentation under scaling symmetry and (b) primary atomization in terms of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) mixing with a strong variation density.

It is up to date, comprehensive, designed for teaching, and based on a course taught by the author at Cornell University for a number of years. The book consists of two parts followed by a number of appendices. Part I provides a general introduction to turbulent flows, how they behave, how they can be described quantitatively, and the fundamental physical processes involved. The topics covered include: the Navier–Stokes equations; the statistical representation of turbulent flelds; mean-flow equations; the behavior of simple free shear and wall-bounded flows; the energy cascade; turbulence spectra; and the Kolmogorov hypotheses. Part II is concerned with various approaches for modelling or simulating turbulent flows. The approaches described are: direct numerical simulation (DNS); turbulent-viscosity models (e.g., the k–$\epsilon$ model); Reynolds-stress models; probability-density-function (PDF) methods; and large-eddy simulation (LES). There are numerous appendices in which the necessary mathematical techniques are presented. This book is primarily intended as a graduate-level text in turbulent flows for engineering students, but it may also be valuable to students in applied mathematics, physics, oceanography, and atmospheric sciences, as well as researchers, and practicing engineers.},

  abstract = {A stochastic implementation of the Multiple Mapping Conditioning (MMC) approach has been applied to a turbulent piloted jet diffusion flame (Sandia flame F) that is close to extinction. Two classic mixing models (Curl's and IEM) are introduced in the MMC context to model the turbulent mixing. The suggested model involves the use of a reference space (that is mapped to mixture fraction space) in order to define particle proximity. The addition of the MMC ideas to the IEM and Curl's models, that is suggested in the current work, aspires to combine the simplicity of these two models with the enforced compositional locality without violating the linearity and independence principles. The formulation of the approach is discussed in detail and results are presented for the mixing field and reactive species. The predictions are compared with joint-scalar PDF simulations using the same mixing models and experimental data. Moreover, the sensitivity of the model to the particle number is examined. It is shown that MMC is less sensitive to the number of particles and can generally produce improved predictions of major and minor chemically reacting species with a lower number of particles.},

  abstract = {The two-phase filtered mass density function (FMDF) method is employed for large eddy simulation (LES) of high speed evaporating and combusting n-heptane sprays using simple (global) and complex (skeletal) chemical kinetic mechanisms. The resolved fluid velocity and pressure fields are obtained by solving the filtered compressible Navier-Stokes equations with high-order Eulerian finite difference methods. The liquid spray and gas scalar (temperature and species mass fractions) fields are both obtained by Lagrangian stochastic models. The chemistry calculation is accelerated by incorporating the parallel in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT) method. There are two-way interactions among Eulerian and Lagrangian fields. Simulations of evaporating sprays with and without combustion indicate that the two-phase LES/FMDF results are consistent and compare well with the available experimental data at different gas temperatures and oxygen concentrations. The spray controlled flame tends to move away from a diffusion flame structure toward a premixed one as the oxygen concentration decreases and/or the ambient gas temperature increases because of changes in spray-induced turbulence and mixing. The LES/FMDF results for ignition delay show more sensitivity to the chemical kinetic model at lower gas temperatures due to slower reaction and stronger turbulence-chemistry interactions. The liftoff length is less sensitive to the kinetics.},

  abstract = {Large-Eddy Simulation (LES), Detached-Eddy Simulation (DES) and Scale-Adaptive Simulation (SAS) are increasingly being used as engineering tools to predict the behaviour of complex industrial flows. Often the flows studied have not been examined previously and the required grid resolution is unknown. Industrial users studying these flows tend to be using commercial CFD codes and do not usually have access to high-performance computing facilities. Due to the significant computing times required, it is difficult to undertake systematic grid-dependence studies. There is therefore a risk that LES, DES and SAS will be performed using overly coarse grids which may lead to unreliable predictions. The present work surveys a number of practical techniques that provide a means of assessing the quality of the grid resolution in large-eddy simulations and related approaches. To examine the usefulness of these techniques, a gas release in a ventilated room is examined using DES and SAS. The grid resolution measures indicate that overall the grids used are relatively coarse. Both DES and SAS model predictions are found to be in poor agreement with experimental data compared to steady and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) results using the SST model. The SAS model also shows the greatest grid sensitivity of the four models tested. The work highlights the need for grid-dependence studies and the potential problems of using coarse grids.},

  abstract = {Fig. 1 Lift distribution of the {\textregistered} rst test case. Fig. 2 Objective function distribution, lift coef{\textregistered} cient with a penalty for airfoil thickness. To see the effect of the constraint as a penalty, the objective func-tion is now rede{\textregistered} ned by using a penalty function with the airfoil thickness t/ c as F = C l ¢ exp[ ¡ 100 {\pounds} (j t / c ¡ 0.15 j)] (2) The correspondingfunctiondistributionis shown in Fig. 2. Although distinct, multiple peaks are greatly reduced,most of the design space now has zeros or negative objective function values. The design space with positive objective function values is found only in the narrow ridge where the constraint is satis{\textregistered} ed, and it still contains {\textregistered} ve local extrema. This is another typical situation where GM has dif{\textregistered} culty. Figure 2 also suggests that the design variables are improperly de{\textregistered} ned. However, this is realized only after the distribution of the objective function is calculated. The task of optimization is to {\textregistered} nd an optimum without computing a global distribution of objective funcitons. Inasmuch as aerodynamic function behaves unexpect-edly even in this simpli{\textregistered} ed problem, a certain mechanism to locate a global optimum is required. The combination of mutation and recombination of GA will be effective to {\textregistered} nd an optimal solution. On the other hand, a simple hill-climbing strategy requires the ini-tial design to be very close to the optimum. Thus, the hill-climbing strategy is practically inapplicable to these kinds of problems. The second test case considersthe lift maximization with a full set of four design variables. This time, the three optimization methods were actually run for comparison. The same constraint and ¯ ow condition were used. Figure 3 summarizes convergence history of the optimum lift values obtained from all three methods. For GM, ADS V3.0, a Fortran program for automated design synthesis, was used. 8 Among the options of the code, the fea-sible direction method was used. The gradient information was given by the {\textregistered} nite difference method. From the preceding test case, it is obvious that performance of GM will depend on the initial guess. Thus, the four apparent initial designs were used for the opti-mization: (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4) = (1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 0, 1). These four runs gave four different results. The best re-sult shown in Fig. 3 [from the second set of the initial values, (0, 1, 0, 0)] indicates the maximum lift coef{\textregistered} cient of 1.716 at 159 func-tion evaluations, whereas the worst run [the third set, (0, 0, 1, 0)] Fig. 3 Comparison of optimization histories among GM, SA, and GA. does not allow the computation to continue after reaching negative thickness of the airfoil. For SA, the algorithm combined with the downhill simplex method (as described in Ref. 3), is used. The cooling schedule was decided on the basis of trial and error so that the optimization prob-lem was computed within a reasonable time. Because all four runs found some local maxima starting from the same initial designs as the GM case, SA is more robust than GM. However, like GM, it gave four different results. The best result [shown in Fig. 3 (from the third set)] gave the lift coef{\textregistered} cient of 1.728 at 217 iterations, which is slightly better than the result of the GM case. For GA, the simple GA in Ref. 4 is adapted for the real number coding of the design variables. One design variable is represented by two real numbers, r1 and r2, for example, a 1 = 0.65 ¢ r1 + 0.35 ¢ r 2 (3) A simple roulette wheel selection operator is used here with a linear {\textregistered} tness scaling. The crossover operator exchanges the real numbers r 2 for each design variable at probability of 0.5. The mutation oper-ator adds a uniform random number between ¡ 0.1 and + 0.1 to the real numbers r1 and r 2 at probability of 0.2. There is no particular initial design here, but the initial population was created by assign-ing three uniform random numbers in an interval from ¡ 5 to + 5 to a 1 , a 2 , and a 3 and by calculating a 4 = 1 ¡ a 1 ¡ a 2 ¡ a 3 . In this run, we used 36 members for the population. After 27 generations, the optimal design was found. This corresponds to 972 function evaluations, roughly six times of the GM case. The lift coef{\textregistered} cient of the GA case is 2.480, which is the best of the three and much higher than those of the GM and SA cases. Although both GA and SA are capable of getting out of local extrema, GA outperformsSA. This is becauseGA searchesan optimum in parallel from a population, whereas SA allows only a single perturbation at each step. Thus, the result of GA depends on the initial design less than that of SA. The comparison of number of function evaluations required for the three methods indicates that GA is the most time consuming. However, if we use GM or SA, we would have to run it starting from many different initial designs to obtain a comparable result. Because there are no guidelines on properly choosing the initial design, an exhaustive, random search must be performed. Or, if we sample {\textregistered} ve initial designs evenly from each design variable, then we would need 20 trial runs for the present case. As a result, GM and SA will not have any advantage in ef{\textregistered} ciency. Overall, GA is the best choice for this test case. In general, aerodynamic performance is sensitive to geometries. So far, any theory of ¯ uid dynamics cannot tell us how to choose design variables that will guarantee the convexness of the objective function.

Thus, the distribution of the objectivefunction will be quite unexpectedand the resultingaerody-namic optimization problem will be very dif{\textregistered} cult.

  abstract = {The composition Probability Density Function (PDF) model is coupled with a Reynolds-averaged k - $\epsilon$ turbulence model and three computationally efficient, yet widely used chemical mechanisms to simulate transient n-heptane spray injection and ignition in a high temperature and high density ambient fluid. Molecular diffusion is modelled by three mixing models, namely the interaction by exchange with the mean (IEM), modified Curl (MC) and Euclidean minimum spanning trees (EMST) models. The liquid phase is modelled by a discrete phase model (DPM). This represents among the first applications of the PDF method in practical diesel engine conditions. A non-reacting case is first considered, with the focus on the ability of the model to capture the spray structure, e.g.; vapour penetration and liquid length, fuel mixture fraction and its variance. Reacting cases are then investigated to compare and evaluate the three different chemical mechanisms and the three mixing models. It is concluded that the EMST mixing model in conjunction with a reduced chemical kinetic model (Lu et al.; Combust Flame 156(8):1542-1551, 2009) performs the best among the options considered. The sensitivity of the results to the choice of the mixing constant is also studied to understand its effect on the flame ignition and stabilisation. Finally, the PDF model is compared to a well-mixed model that assumes turbulent fluctuations are negligible, which has been widely used in the diesel spray combustion community. Significant structural differences in the modelled flame are revealed comparing the PDF method with the well-mixed model. Quantitatively, the PDF model exhibits excellent agreement with the measurements and shows much better results than the well-mixed model in all ambient O 2 and temperature conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

@article{Meneveau1996a,
  abstract = {The dynamic model for large-eddy simulation of turbulence samples information from the resolved velocity field in order to optimize subgrid-scale model coefficients. When the method is used in conjunction with the Smagorinsky eddy-viscosity model, and the sampling process is formulated in a spatially local fashion, the resulting coefficient field is highly variable and contains a significant fraction of negative values. Negative eddy viscosity leads to computational instability and as a result the model is always augmented with a stabilization mechanism. In most applications the model is stabilized by averaging the relevant equations over directions of statistical homogeneity. While this approach is effective, and is consistent with the statistical basis underlying the eddy-viscosity model, it is not applicable to complex-geometry inhomogeneous flows. Existing local formulations, intended for inhomogeneous flows, are most commonly stabilized by artificially constraining the coefficient to be positive. In this paper we introduce a new dynamic model formulation, that combines advantages of the statistical and local approaches. We propose to accumulate the required averages over flow pathlines rather than over directions of statistical homogeneity. This procedure allows the application of the dynamic model with averaging to inhomogeneous flows in complex geometries. We analyse direct numerical simulation data to document the effects of such averaging on the Smagorinsky coefficient. The characteristic Lagrangian time scale over which the averaging is performed is chosen based on measurements of the relevant Lagrangian autocorrelation functions, and on the requirement that the model be purely dissipative, guaranteeing numerical stability when coupled with the Smagorinsky model. The formulation is tested in forced and decaying isotropic turbulence and in fully developed and transitional channel flow. In homogeneous flows, the results are similar to those of the volume-averaged dynamic model, while in channel flow, the predictions are slightly superior to those of the spatially (planar) averaged dynamic model. The relationship between the model and vortical structures in isotropic turbulence, as well as ejection events in channel flow, is investigated. Computational overhead is kept small (about 10{\%} above the CPU requirements of the spatially averaged dynamic model) by using an approximate scheme to advance the Lagrangian tracking through first-order Euler time integration and linear interpolation in space.},

The numerical model is based on a stochastic separated flow technique that includes submodels for droplet dynamics, heat and mass transfer, and droplet-droplet collisions. Because the spray characteristics near the nozzle are difficult to ascertain, a new method for initialization of particle diameter size is developed that assumes a Rosin-Rammler distribution for droplet size, which correctly reproduces experimentally measured Sauter and arithmetic mean diameters. By relating the particle initialization to lower moments of the droplet statistics, it is possible to take advantage of measurements without substantial penalties associated with the greater experimental uncertainty of individual droplet measurements. Overall, very good agreement is observed in the comparisons of experimental measurements to computational predictions for the streamwise development of mean drop size and velocity. In addition, the importance of modeling droplet-droplet collisions is highlighted with comparison of selected droplet-droplet collision models. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Celis2015,
  abstract = {Compared to other simulation approaches utilized for modeling turbulent reacting flows with detailed chemistry, probability density function (PDF) methods offer several advantages. This is because the changes in fluid composition due to convection and reaction processes can be treated exactly. PDF methods require however closure models for the mixing process representing the transport of the PDF owing to molecular diffusion. Over the years several mixing models with different degrees of complexity have been developed. A review of the main Lagrangian mixing models for turbulent combustion developed so far is presented in this work. This review includes models where the composition of a particle changes (i) essentially independently of the composition associated with the other particles, and (ii) through direct interaction with other particles. The main advantages and shortcomings of the mixing models reviewed are highlighted accordingly. Because Lagrangian Monte Carlo techniques are usually used for solving PDF transport equations, a particular emphasis is put on their corresponding particle implementation. The mixing models review is preceded by a section highlighting the mathematical formulation associated with the use of PDF methods for turbulent reacting flows. In the last part of the article both comparative results of mixing models performance and prospects for the mixing models are discussed. Despite the effort that has been devoted to the development of more capable mixing models, currently there is no mixing model presenting all desirable characteristics. Even more, there are significant differences in the results obtained when different mixing models are utilized, especially when higher order scalar statistics are accounted for. Therefore work still needs to be carried out in order to develop a mixing model satisfying all desirable characteristics expected from these models. Several avenues can be further explored in order to achieve this goal. These potential routes include those accounting for spatial scalar structures and both scalar length and turbulent frequency scales distributions. Other approaches based on competitive mixing, manifold-based features and Lagrangian coherent structures have also the potential to further improve upon existing mixing models. The development of a sound mixing model will allow eventually removing one of the largest sources of modeling uncertainty in PDF-based computations.},

The histone fold emerges as a fundamental protein dimerization motif while the differentiations of the tips of the histone dimers appear to provide the rules of core octamer assembly and the basis for nucleosome regulation. We present evidence for the occurrence of the fold from archaebacteria to mammals and propose the use of this structural motif to define a distinct family of proteins, the histone fold superfamily. It appears that evolution has conserved the conformation of the fold even through variations in primary structure and among proteins with various functional roles.},

The analysis of many vaporizing liquid-fuel surfaces in close proximity to each other and enveloped by flames has recently been exam- ined.1–3 A brief review will be given here. New methods allow the treatment of complex quasi-steady spray-combustion configurations with greater ease than previously possible. Examples of configurations include hundreds of fuel droplets, liquid-fuel wall films and pools, and liquid-fuel free films. Analyses are presented for liquid-fuel vaporization and burning both with unitary and non-unitary Lewis number (i.e., similar and non-similar heat and mass diffusion) in a general geometrical situation, e.g., a dense spray. Variable transport properties are consid- ered and only Stefan flow is allowed. It is shown that the problem can conveniently be separated, using a mass-flux potential function (dependent only on the geometry), into a one-dimensional problem for the quasi-steady, gas-phase scalar properties and a three- dimensional problem for the mass-flux potential which satisfies Laplace's equation. The scalar properties are shown to be universal (i.e., independent of configuration) functions of the mass-flux potential only. It is demonstrated that a mass-flux-weighted sensible spe- cific enthalpy is more natural and convenient than the traditional mass-weighted value for the non-unitary-Lewis-number case. This modification results in a new definition of the Lewis number. A generalization of the classical Spalding4,5 heat transfer number is presented. The theory predicts scalar gas-phase profiles, flame position, and vaporization rates. Quantitative results are presented for special cases where the Lewis number is piece- wise constant. The thin-flame temperature and the effective latent heat of vaporization can be determined as functions of the liquid-surface temperature via solution of nonlinear algebraic equations; these values do not depend on the specific configuration and therefore have some universality.},

  abstract = {A one-dimensional numerical model of turbulent mixing in an opposed jet configuration is presented with Monte Carlo simulation of joint scalar probability density function (PDF). The formulation is based on axisymmetric flowfield along its centerline. Due to the one-dimensionality, one can afford a large number of stochastic particles in the PDF Monte Carlo simulation such that statistical uncertainty is reduced to a negligible level. With this accurate numerical representation, we investigate the importance of specification of mixing time (or frequency) in two commonly used mixing models, namely, the modified Curl's mixing model and the interaction by exchange with the mean (IEM) model (or the linear mean square estimation model). The effect of mixing time on the predicted results is investigated by varying the ratio between the turbulence turnover time and the turbulent mixing time. For the experimental data of Sardi et al. (1998), excellent agreement between predictions and the measurements is achieved by using a constant time ratio. A similarly good agreement is also seen in the PDF distributions. An analysis of the computed results reveals a strong correlation between the PDF shape and the peak level of the variance of the mixture fraction. However, it has not been possible for the numerical model to match simultaneously both the variances and the PDF shapes for the experimental results of Mastorakos et al. (1994). Further experiments on the detailed mixing properties in the opposed jet configuration are warranted to establish a comprehensive set of data for validation of numerical models.},

  abstract = {Auto-ignition of sprays plays a key role in diesel engines, high-altitude relight of aircraft engines, and augmenters. The ignition process occurs exclusively at the small scales and represents the interaction of evaporation, turbulent mixing, and combustion. Here, a large eddy simulation (LES) methodology combined with a probability density function (PDF) approach is used to simulate a series of methanol spray flames. To account for the small-scale interaction between spray droplets and the gas-phase combustion process, a stochastic model is proposed. Detailed chemical kinetics is used along with in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT) to accelerate the computations. The simulations produce very good agreement with experimental data. From the LES computations, it is postulated that the ignition process happens through two different mechanisms: an entrainment process that traps droplets in high-temperature oxidizer pockets, and a stratified premixed process. It is shown that without the explicit model for the spray/combustion coupling, a more premixed propagation is observed due to the artificial mixing induced by the algorithm. Finally, it is shown that increased subfilter mixing leads to a reduction in peak temperatures, where ignition kernels are dissipated quickly.},

@article{Faeth1983,
  abstract = {The dense spray region involves low void fractions, effects of nearby drops on drop transport rates, appreciable rates of drop collisions and significant effects of drops on the turbulence properties of the flow. Spray models developed by Anderson et al.,1 Butler et al.4 and Gosman and Johns107 treat some aspects of the dilute spray region; however, the model reported by O'Rourke and Bracco211 represents one of the first comprehensive treatments of dense sprays. The model of Buckingham and Siekhaus151 was developed for dense solid particle flows but could be modified to treat dense spray processes. The predictions obtained by O'Rourke and Bracco211 indicate that effects of adjacent drops on drop transport rates are relatively small for void fractions greater than 0.9; however, drop collision effects are still significant at relatively high void fractions. The predictions of Buckingham and Siekhaus151 indicate that particles tend to reduce turbulence levels and turbulent exchange coefficients primarily due to inertial effects, although additional production of turbulence in particle wakes was ignored in these computations. The results of these computations provide incentive for further study of dense spray problems, but are not definitive since many aspects of the models have not yet been evaluated by comparison with measurements. There is a pressing need to overcome the experimental difficulties of the dense spray region so that further progress can be made toward developing reliable models for this region.},

Atomization is considered as turbulent mixing in a flow with variable density in the limit of large Reynolds and Weber numbers. An assumption similar to the Kolmogorov hypothesis has been invoked: large-scale features of the flow are supposed to he independent of viscosity and surface tension at high Reynolds and Weber numbers; small-scale features do depend on viscosity and surface tension. Dispersion of the liquid in the gas phase is computed by a classical equation for the turbulent diffusion flux of the liquid The mean size of the liquid fragments is obtained with a new equation for the mean surface area of the liquid-gas interface per unit of volume. Discussions concerning this new equation are presented. Several comparisons with experiments are presented, concerning the liquid dispersion as well as the mean size of fragments produced.},

At each point in the flow field, a complete statistical description of the state of the fluid is provided by the velocity-composition joint pdf. This is the joint probability density function (pdf) of the three components of velocity and of the composition variables (species mass fractions and enthalpy). The principal method described is to solve a modelled transport equation for the velocity-composition joint pdf. For a variable-density flow with arbitrarily complex and nonlinear reactions, it is remarkable that in this equation the effects of convection, reaction, body forces and the mean pressure gradient appear exactly and so do not have to be modelled. Even though the joint pdf is a function of many independent variables, its transport equation can be solved by a Monte Carlo method for the inhomogeneous flows of practical interest. A second method that is described briefly is to solve a modelled transport equation for the composition joint pdf. The objective of the paper is to provide a comprehensive and understandable of the theoretical foundations of the pdf approach. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

  abstract = {Large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent reacting sprays is performed to investigate the interactions of droplet evaporation and subfilter scalar mixing processes. A stochastic method is proposed to generate the subfilter fluctuations in gas-phase reactive scalars in the framework of a mixture-fraction-based combustion model. The subfilter fluctuations of the gas-phase temperature and composition, seen by droplets, are used to refine the estimates of the interphase heat/mass transfer rates. Gas-phase combustion is described by the flamelet progress variable approach. The effects of droplet evaporation on subfilter scalar mixing are considered by solving the transport equation for the subfilter mixture fraction variance. The mixture fraction that is valid instantaneously in both the gas and the liquid phases is adopted and its implication on the modeling of the evaporation source term in the subfilter variance equation is discussed. The modeling approach has been applied to the Sydney dilute reacting sprays. To account for uncertainty in the modeling of scalar dissipation rates in spray flames, a parametric study is performed for the constant in the scalar dissipation model for the subfilter variance equation. The effects of subfilter fluctuations on droplet evaporation are found to depend on the inflow condition of the pre-evaporated gas-phase mixture and the liquid injection rate in the present dilute reacting sprays. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Combustion Institute.},

@article{Xu1999a,
  abstract = {This study is to explore the numerical features of a particle-mesh algorithm developed for a stand-alone joint velocity-frequency-composition PDF method for turbulent reactive flows. Numerical experiments are performed on a piloted-jet nonpremixed turbulent flame of methane to characterize and quantify various numerical errors in terms of numerical parameters: number of particles per cellNpc, number of cells M2, and time step $\Delta$ t. First, a stationary solution is obtained and is verified to be independent of the time step $\Delta$ t. Then, the total numerical error is identified as statistical error, bias, and discretization error. It is revealed that the statistical error converges as Npc-1/2, and the bias as Npc-1. The statistical error can be reduced by time-averaging or by performing multiple independent simulation (e.g., with a parallelized program). Finally, the scheme is shown to be second-order accurate - the spatial discretization error converging as M-2. A modified turbulence frequency model based on the turbulence production-to-dissipation ratio is shown to improve the numerical behavior of the turbulence model. These results demonstrate that the particle-mesh method is convergent. Also, the optimal numerical parameters, minimizing computational cost subject to a specified error tolerance, are estimated. An error reduction scheme, similar to Richardson extrapolation, is proposed and shown to be quite effective in reducing the deterministic error. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {We validate and test two algorithms for the time integration of the Boussinesq form of the Navier—Stokes equations within the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) methodology for turbulent flows. The algorithms are implemented in the OpenFOAM framework. From one side, we have implemented an energy-conserving incremental-pressure Runge–Kutta (RK4) projection method for the solution of the Navier–Stokes equations together with a dynamic Lagrangian mixed model for momentum and scalar subgrid-scale (SGS) fluxes; from the other side we revisit the PISO algorithm present in OpenFOAM (pisoFoam) in conjunction with the dynamic eddy-viscosity model for SGS momentum fluxes and a Reynolds Analogy for the scalar SGS fluxes, and used for the study of turbulent channel flows and buoyancy-driven flows. In both cases the validity of the anisotropic filter function, suited for non-homogeneous hexahedral meshes, has been studied and proven to be useful for industrial LES. Preliminary tests on energy-conservation properties of the algorithms studied (without the inclusion of the subgrid-scale models) show the superiority of RK4 over pisoFoam, which exhibits dissipative features. We carried out additional tests for wall-bounded channel flow and for Rayleigh–B{\`{e}}nard convection in the turbulent regime, by running LES using both algorithms. Results show the RK4 algorithm together with the dynamic Lagrangian mixed model gives better results in the cases analyzed for both first- and second-order statistics. On the other hand, the dissipative features of pisoFoam detected in the previous tests reflect in a less accurate evaluation of the statistics of the turbulent field, although the presence of the subgrid-scale model improves the quality of the results compared to a correspondent coarse direct numerical simulation. In case of Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection, the results of pisoFoam improve with increasing values of Rayleigh number, and this may be attributed to the Reynolds Analogy used for the subgrid-scale temperature fluxes. Finally, we point out that the present analysis holds for hexahedral meshes. More research is need for extension of the methods proposed to general unstructured grids.},

The viewpoint is from that of the empiricist, focusing on experimental results and the physically based theories that have emerged from their interpretations, as well as from the theoretically founded notions that have been supported. Pertinent concepts from laminar lifted flame stabilization studies are introduced at the onset. Classification in broad categories of the types of turbulent lifted flame theories is then presented. Experiments are discussed which support the importance of a variety of effects, including partial premixing, edge-flames, local extinction, streamline divergence and large-scale structures. This discussion details which of the categories of theories are supported by particular experiments, comments on the experimental results themselves and their salient contributions. Overall conclusions on the state of the field are drawn and future directions for research are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Computational models for combustion must account for complex and inherently interconnected physical processes including dispersion, mixing, chemical reactions, particulate nucleation and growth and, critically, the interactions of these with turbulence. The development of affordable and accurate models that are widely applicable is a work in progress. Stochastic multiple mapping conditioning (MMC) is a fast-emerging approach that has been successfully applied to non-premixed, premixed and partially premixed flames as well to the modelling of liquid and solid particulate synthesis. The method solves the conventional PDF transport equation but incorporates an additional constraint in that the mixing is localised in a reference space. This paper describes the numerical implementation of stochastic MMC in an OpenFOAM compatible code called mmcFoam. The model concepts and equations along with alternative submodels, code structure and numerical schemes are explained. A focus is placed on validation of the computational methods in particular demonstrating numerical convergence and mass consistency of the hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian schemes. Four validation cases are selected including a combustion direct numerical simulation (DNS) case, two combustion experimental jet flame cases and a non-combusting particulate synthesis case. The results show that the total mass and mass distribution of Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes are consistent and confirm that the solutions numerically converge with increasing number of stochastic computational particles and sections for describing particulate size distribution.},

In order to construct an estimate of the solution error in Finite Volume calculations, it is first necessary to examine its sources. Discretisation errors can be divided into two groups: errors caused by the discretisation of the solution domain and equation discretisation errors. The first group includes insufficient mesh reso- lution, mesh skewness and non-orthogonality. In the case of the second order Finite Volume method, equation discretisation errors are represented through numerical diffusion. Numerical diffusion coefficients from the discretisation of the convection term and the temporal derivative are derived. In an attempt to reduce numeri- cal diffusion from the convection term, a new stabilised and bounded second-order differencing scheme is proposed. Three new methods of error estimation are presented. The Direct Taylor Series Error estimate is based on the Taylor series truncation error analysis. It is set up to enable single-mesh single-run error estimation. The Moment Error estimate derives the solution error from the cell imbalance in higher moments of the solution. A suitable normalisation is used to estimate the error magnitude. The Residual Error estimate is based on the local inconsistency between face interpolation and volume integration. Extensions of the method to transient flows and the Local Residual Problem error estimate are also given. Finally, an automatic error-controlled adaptive mesh refinement algorithm is set up in order to automatically produce a solution of pre-determined accuracy. It uses mesh refinement and unrefinement to control the local error magnitude. The method is tested on several characteristic flow situations, ranging from incompressible to supersonic flows, for both steady-state and transient problems.},

  abstract = {Transported probability density function (PDF) methods have shown promise in modeling canonical flame configurations. More recently, they have been applied to simple engine configurations to demonstrate their feasibility in more practical applications, and to demonstrate the importance of accurate accounting for turbulence/chemistry interactions (TCI) in IC engines. The research conducted here advances the state-of-the-art in two areas: advanced physical models and numerical methods for multiphase chemically reacting turbulent flows; and advanced combustion systems for direct-injection diesel engines. The hypotheses that are tested in this thesis are that turbulent fluctuations significantly impact heat release and emissions in advanced diesel engines and that PDF methods capture TCI effects in real engines. Contributions to modeling and algorithms include: (1) liquid fuel spray/PDF coupling; (2) real engine applications of PDF particle tracking through complex meshes; and (3) modularization of coupling among detailed thermochemistry and PDF methods. Contributions to engine combustion have included: (1) multiple-cycle calculations; (2) modeled premixed/direct-injection splits; (3) insight into the roles of turbulence and TCI on autoignition and emissions; (4) detailed information from the PDF method including spatial non-homogeneity, fluctuation effects, NOx and soot prediction, and detailed speciation; and (5) quantitative comparisons between CFD and experiment for a real engine. This research shows that turbulence/chemistry interactions in real engine applications are important to understanding and modeling engine combustion. The work allows for better analysis and performance prediction of advanced engine designs and points to how the models may be improved. Already, the PDF model's application to the real engine case here has shown appreciably better robustness and quantitative accuracy in ignition and emissions predictions compared to a conventional finite-volume approach where TCI is not considered. Ignition timing, heat release, and emissions are captured favorably with the PDF method. Directions for future improvement and research are suggested to address the remaining modeling issues.},

  abstract = {This paper details a quantitative joint temperature, OH, and CH2O imaging experiment designed to investigate the stabilization of lifted turbulent methane flames issuing into a high temperature vitiated coflow. Temperature is determined through Rayleigh imaging, and the data are used to quantify OH-LIF excited at 283.011 nm, and to enable to semi-quantification of CH2O-LIF excited at 355 nm. A fuel with Rayleigh cross-section equal to that of the vitiated coflow was used to improve accuracy in the processing of the Rayleigh temperature. Results of the experiment have been presented, and compared to simulations of laminar transient autoignition flamelets. The images were classified in three main categories: (i) CH2O only, (ii) ignition kernels, and (iii) liftoff flames. Images of type (i) and (ii) were dominant in the early part of the jet, while images of type (iii) were dominant after the mean stabilization height. By examining OH and CH2O conditional on the size of the kernel, it was found that the sequence of conditional data was analogous to the evolution of autoignition, following the key stages of (1) build-up of a precursor pool, (2) initiation of reaction, and (3) formation of a steady flame. Viewed in such a sequence, CH2O peaks prior to the autoignition and then decays after ignition, and OH is found to peak at ignition and these peaks are maintained into the established steady flames. This is in qualitative agreement with the laminar transient flamelet calculations. The data are consistent with the view that autoignition is the main stabilization mechanism in this lifted flame. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract = {The theory stemming from the statistical representation of turbulent flames is pre? sented and developed, the major aim being to describe the basic processes in relatively simple flames. Starting from conservation equations, with the assumption of low Mach number and high Reynolds number, it is shown that the properties at any point in the flame can be determined from the transport equations for the velocity U and a set of scalars {\textless}j{\textgreater}$\backslash$ {\textless}j{\textgreater} rep? resents the species mass fractions and enthalpy. However, the solution of these equations with initial conditions and boundary conditions appropriate to turbulent flames is pro? hibitively difficult. Statistical theories attempt to describe the behaviour of averaged quantities in terms of averaged quantities. This requires the introduction of closure approximations, but renders a more readily soluble set of equations. A closure of fthe Reynolds-stress equations and the equation for the joint probability density function of (f{\textgreater} is considered. The use of the joint probability density function (p.d.f.) equation removes the difficulties that are otherwise encountered due to non-linear functions of the scalars (such as reaction rates). While the transport equation for the joint p.d.f. provides a useful description of the physics, its solution is feasible only for simple cases. As a practical alternative, a general method is presented for estimating the joint p.d.f. from its first and second moments: transport equations for these quantities are also considered therefore. Modelled transport equations for the Reynolds stresses, the dissipation rate, scalar moments and scalar fluxes are discussed, including the effects of reaction and density variations. A physical interpretation of the joint p.d.f. equation is given and the modelling of the unknown terms is considered. A general method for estimating the joint p.d.f. is presented. It assumes that the joint p.d.f. is the statistically most likely distribution with the same first and second moments. This distribution is determined for any number of reactive or non-reactive scalars.},

The strategy consists of coupling an academic CMC code with the commercial CFD software Star-CD (CD-adapco). Two issues have been investigated: firstly, the applicability of conventional spray models to LES and secondly, LES-CMC for spray combustion. Conventional spray models that were originally developed for use in Reynolds-averaged equations have been assessed for their applicability within the LES framework by conducting non-reacting spray computations. Liquid core penetration, spray spreading angle and vapour phase penetration have been compared to the available experimental data and the agreement between LES and experiments is satisfactory. Several reacting spray calculations have been performed with a range of initial mixture and temperature conditions, which mimic Diesel engine configurations. The computed auto-ignition time and flame lift-off length are in good agreement with the experimental data. Despite the uncertainties associated with the spray models and the chemistry, the results illustrate that the LES-CMC methodology can reproduce well the experimental results.},

In this paper the Eulerian multiphase approach and the Eulerian single-phase approach are compared and the results lead to an intermediate quasi-multiphase approach for describing the spray core.

A hybrid approach is used that consists of an Eulerian LES, a stochastic filtered density function method with MMC closure and an inertial Lagrangian fuel particle scheme. A simultaneous interphase heat and mass transfer model with conserved scalar Spalding transfer numbers and localness in mixture fraction space models the pyrolysis of solid fuel particles and volatile gas mixing in the unresolved diffusive layer around each fuel particle. The MMC-LES model is applied to a laboratory-scale, turbulent, pyrolysing coal flame and the predictions are found to be in good overall agreement with the experimental data and comparable to previously reported LES and carrier-phase direct numerical simulations. This paper focuses on the sensitivity of the predictions to numerical parameters and variations in the models for pyrolysis rate and volatile gas composition. Both single first order reaction rate and competing rate pyrolysis models are used and the volatile composition is modelled as both pure methane and a detailed gaseous mixture. The sensitivity of these variations on the predictions of temperature and reactive species mass fractions is marked. Additionally the sensitivity to the presence of envelope flames around individual coal particles is explored and while there are some minor local variations, the steady-state statistics do not vary much.},

  abstract = {A new approach to chemistry modelling for large-eddy simulation of turbulent reacting flows is developed. Instead of solving transport equations for all of the numerous species in a typical chemical mechanism and modelling the unclosed chemical source terms, the present study adopts an indirect mapping approach, whereby all of the detailed chemical processes are mapped to a reduced system of tracking scalars. Here, only two such scalars are considered: a mixture fraction variable, which tracks the mixing of fuel and oxidizer, and a progress variable, which tracks the global extent of reaction of the local mixture. The mapping functions, which describe all of the detailed chemical processes with respect to the tracking variables, are determined by solving quasi-steady diffusion-reaction equations with complex chemical kinetics and multicomponent mass diffusion. The performance of the new model is compared to fast-chemistry and steady-flamelet models for predicting velocity, species concentration, and temperature fields in a methane-fuelled coaxial jet combustor for which experimental data are available. The progress-variable approach is able to capture the unsteady, lifted flame dynamics observed in the experiment, and to obtain good agreement with the experimental data, while the fast-chemistry and steady-flamelet models both predict an attached flame.},

  abstract = {Numerical modeling of several turbulent nonreacting and reacting spray jets is carried out using a fully stochastic separated flow (FSSF) approach. As is widely used, the carrier-phase is considered in an Eulerian framework, while the dispersed phase is tracked in a Lagrangian framework following the stochastic separated flow (SSF) model. Various interactions between the two phases are taken into account by means of two-way coupling. Spray evaporation is described using a thermal model with an infinite conductivity in the liquid phase. The gas-phase turbulence terms are closed using the k- $\epsilon$ model. A novel mixture fraction based approach is used to stochastically model the fluctuating temperature and composition in the gas phase and these are then used to refine the estimates of the heat and mass transfer rates between the droplets and the surrounding gas-phase. In classical SSF (CSSF) methods, stochastic fluctuations of only the gas-phase velocity are modeled.Successful implementation of the FSSF approach to turbulent nonreacting and reacting spray jets is demonstrated. Results are compared against experimental measurements as well as with predictions using the CSSF approach for both nonreacting and reacting spray jets. The FSSF approach shows little difference from the CSSF predictions for nonreacting spray jets but differences are significant for reacting spray jets. In general, the FSSF approach gives good predictions of the flame length and structure but further improvements in modeling may be needed to improve the accuracy of some details of the predictions. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract = {Autoignition and stabilization of n-Dodecane spray combustion under diesel engine like conditions are investigated using large eddy simulation and detailed chemical kinetics. The Spray A cases of Engine Combustion Network (ECN) with ambient temperatures of 900 K and 1000 K are considered. Two-stage ignition behavior is predicted in the studied conditions. It is found that the first-stage ignition occurs on the fuel-lean mixture, whereas the second-stage ignition starts on the fuel-rich mixture. The first stage ignition in the fuel-lean mixture promotes the first and the second stage ignition in the fuel-rich mixture owing to rapid turbulent mixing. Two mechanisms, autoignition and flame propagation coupling with the low temperature ignition, are used to explain the lift-off position and stabilization of the combustion process. They compete with each other, and their relative importance depends on the ambient temperature. The ambient temperature is shown to affect the soot emission in the flame through its influences on the lift-off length and the reaction zone structure. Higher ambient temperature results in a shorter lift-off length, which gives rise to higher soot emission due to the lower air entrainment to the fuel-rich zone in front of the flame. In the lower temperature case, the flame is stabilized by an autoignition induced flame front where a considerable amount of fuel is oxidized to CO at the leading front of the flame. Consequently, it reduces the soot formation in the flame.},

  abstract = {This thesis provides detailed set of data which forms a base for the development of predictive models for dilute non-reacting and reacting spray jets. The spray burner is simple with well defined initial and boundary conditions. A range of non-reacting spray jets and flames of acetone and ethanol with different droplet loadings and carrier velocities are investigated using techniques such as Phase Doppler Particle Anemometry (PDPA), Mie scattering and laser induced fluorescence (LIF). Detailed measurements of droplet velocity and si2e have been performed at the burner exit plane as well as at a number of axial locations downstream of the exit plane. Issues such as droplet- turbulence interaction in dilute sprays have been addressed. The effect of nozzle wall on droplet velocity has been identified and analyzed. In non-reacting spray jets all droplets are partially responsive to the gas phase. The non-reacting spray jets have been found to decay faster than the reacting spray jets. The spatial compositional structures of acetone and ethanol spray flames are obtained using LIF technique. Joint acetone/OFI LIF images show diffusion, as well as premixed flame structures, as the droplet loading and carrier velocity is varied. Group combustion features such as external group combusdon, internal group combustion and single droplet combustion have been identified in acetone flames. The applicability of group combustion number to spray jet flames has been tested. Simultaneous Mie scattering, and CH20 / 0H LIF images show ethanol flames burning as diffusion and premixed flames, as the droplet loading and carrier air velocity is varied. Double reaction zones have been observed in ethanol flames. Local heat release is obtained for ethanol spray flames. Single droplet combustion has been identified using the heat release and droplet images. Finite rate chemistry effects have been looked at in acetone and ethanol flames close to global blow off. As blow off is approached the reaction zones in the acetone flames show broad flames fronts while ethanol flames show dual structures of thick reaction zones as well as thin strips of OH with possible local extinction.},

Due to progress of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of two phase flows it is now possible to simulate the primary break-up of a Diesel spray [Menard, T., Tanguy, S., Berlemont, A., 2007. Coupling level set/VOF/ghost fluid methods: validation and application to 3D simulation of the primary break-up of a liquid jet. Int. J. Multiphase Flow 33 (5), 510-524]. The present formulation of the so-called ELSA (Eulerian-Lagrangian Spray Atomization model) [Vallet, A., Borghi, R., 1999. Mod{\'{e}}lisation Eulerienne de L'atomisation d'un Jet Liquide. C. R. Acad.

Once constants and parameters of the model are fixed thanks to comparisons with DNS, the model is tested with experimental data. The liquid and vapour penetrations show a good agreement when they are compared to experiments of Diesel atomization. In particular the influence of the gas temperature is well recovered. For different temperatures, similarly to the experiments, vapour penetrations are unchanged, but the corresponding equivalent ratio fields are strongly modified. Finally, the combustion model ECFM-3Z [Colin, O., Benkenida, A., 2004. The 3-zones extended coherent flame model (ecfm-3z) for computing premixed/diffusion combustion. Oil Gas Sci.

The models considered are those used in droplet laden flow calculations such as direct numerical simulations for which large numbers of individual (isolated) droplet solutions are obtained. Diameter and temperature evolution predictions are made for single-component droplets of benzene, decane, heptane, hexane and water with relatively large initial sizes {\~{}}1 mm vaporizing in convective air flows. All of the models perform nearly identically for low evaporation rates at gas temperatures significantly lower than the boiling temperature. For gas temperatures at and above the boiling point, large deviations are found between the various model predictions. The simulated results reveal that non-equilibrium effects become significant when the initial droplet diameter is {\textless}50 $\mu$m and that these effects are enhanced with increasing slip velocity. It is additionally observed that constant properties can be used throughout each simulation if both the gas and vapor values are calculated at either the wet-bulb or boiling temperature. The models based on the Langmuir-Knudsen law and a corrected (for evaporation effects) analytical heat transfer expression derived from the quasi-steady gas phase assumption are shown to agree most favorably with a wide variety of experimental results. Since the experimental droplet sizes are all much larger than the limit for non-equilibrium effects to be important, for these conditions the most crucial aspect of the current Langmuir-Knudsen models is the corrected analytical form for the heat transfer expression as compared to empirical relations used in the remaining models.},

@article{Pandal2017,
  abstract = {The dense spray region in the near-field of diesel fuel injection remains an enigma. This region is difficult to interrogate with light in the visible range and difficult to model due to the rapid interaction between liquid and gas. In particular, modeling strategies that rely on Lagrangian particle tracking of droplets have struggled in this area. To better represent the strong interaction between phases, Eulerian modeling has proven particularly useful. Models built on the concept of surface area density are advantageous where primary and secondary atomization have not yet produced droplets, but rather form more complicated liquid structures. Surface area density, a more general concept than Lagrangian droplets, naturally represents liquid structures, no matter how complex. These surface area density models, however, have not been directly experimentally validated in the past due to the inability of optical methods to elucidate such a quantity. Optical diagnostics traditionally measure near-spherical droplet size far downstream, where the spray is optically thin. Using ultra-small-angle x-ray scattering (USAXS) measurements to measure the surface area and x-ray radiography to measure the density, we have been able to test one of the more speculative parts of Eulerian spray modeling. The modeling and experimental results have been combined to provide insight into near-field spray dynamics.},

  abstract = {An extension of the flamelet/progress variable (FPV) model for the prediction of extinction and reignition is applied in large-eddy simulation (LES) of flames D and E of the Sandia piloted turbulent jet flame series. This model employs a presumed probability density function (PDF), in which the marginal PDF of a reactive scalar is modeled by a statistically most likely distribution. This provides two advantages. First of all, the shape of the distribution depends on chemical and mixing time-scale information, and second, an arbitrary number of moments can be enforced. This model was analyzed in an a priori study in the first part of this work. In the present LES application, the first two moments of mixture fraction and reaction progress variable are used to constrain the shape of the presumed PDF. Transport equations for these quantities are solved, and models for the residual scalar dissipation rates, which appear as unclosed terms in the equations for the scalar variances, are provided. Statistical flow field quantities for axial velocity, mixture fraction, and temperature, obtained from the extended FPV model, are in good agreement with experimental data. Mixture-fraction-conditioned data, conditional PDFs, and burning indices are computed and compared with the delta-function flamelet closure model, which employs a Dirac distribution as a model for the marginal PDF of the reaction progress parameter. The latter model considerably underpredicts the amount of local extinction, which shows that the consideration of second-moment information in the presumed PDF of the reaction progress parameter is important for the accurate prediction of extinction and reignition. Mixture-fraction-conditioned results obtained from the extended FPV model are in good agreement with experimental data; however, the overprediction of the consumption of fuel and oxidizer on the fuel-rich side results in an overprediction of minor species. The predictions for the conditional PDFs and burning indices are in good agreement with measurements.},

For the treatment of convection and diffusion two approaches are well established, either from Eulerian or Lagrangian point of view. Simply speaking, the former is computationally less expensive but also less accurate than the latter one. In this paper we provide an extension of a previous analysis of numerical diffusion of Eulerian schemes to two-dimensional flows in order to shed light on the shortcomings of this approach. For convergence acceleration, local time stepping is extended to Lagrangian pdf methods. Furthermore, the adaption of the Continuous Mixing Model to unequal particle weights is presented. The differences between the Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches are analyzed by application to simple test problems and by simulation of a supersonic hydrogen-air diffusion flame using a chemical scheme consisting of seven elementary reactions.

A 2D, axisymmetric flow-model fully coupled with the scalar fields, is employed. A detailed chemical kinetic scheme is included, and first order CMC is applied. Simulations are carried out for different jet velocities and coflow temperatures (Tc). The predicted liftoff generally agrees with experimental data, as well as joint-PDF results. Profiles of mean scalar fluxes in the mixture fraction space, for Tc= 1025 and 1080 K reveal that (1) Inside the flame zone, the chemical term balances the molecular diffusion term, and hence the structure is of a diffusion flamelet for both cases. (2) In the pre-flame zone, the structure depends on the coflow temperature: for the 1025 K case, the chemical term being small, the advective term balances the axial turbulent diffusion term. However, for the 1080 K case, the chemical term is large and balances the advective term, the axial turbulent diffusion term being small. It is concluded that, lift-off is controlled (a) by turbulent premixed flame propagation for low coflow temperature while (b) by autoignition for high coflow temperature. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Combustion Institute.

A method to identify spray plume boundary from the predicted flow field that offers a meaningful comparison to experimental definition was discussed in detail. Using the experimental data available in literature, a comparison between axi-symmetric and asymmetric nozzles was made to assess the nature of the influence of the nozzle geometry and the operating conditions on the ensuing spray. On the basis of this comparison, it was inferred that the spray plume angle of asymmetric nozzles is largely geometry dependent for a wide range of pressure ratios.},

  abstract = {A conditional moment closure (CMC) method has been coupled to a large eddy simulation (LES) for the modelling of turbulent spray flames. The present study presents an extension to CMC (CMCe) that remediates some inconsistencies of an earlier LES-CMC study (Ukai et al., 2013) [1]. Here, the CMC approach is coupled with a chemistry table that allows for spatial and temporal variations of the tabulated chemical composition and ensures a reasonably accurate computation of the chemical source term of the LES-filtered reaction progress variable despite large fluctuations around the conditional means computed by the CMC equation. CMCe is validated by comparison with experimental results of two dilute acetone spray flames with pre-evaporation. Temperature predictions and axial spray velocities are markedly improved, especially along the centreline, while the velocity RMS shows reasonable agreement.},

Analysis of numerical diffusion and stability of differencing schemes implemented in OpenFOAM software package has been carried out. Based on the obtained results, differencing schemes are selected and their modification has been done. An algorithm has been presented for combining various approaches for modelling turbulent flows (RANS-LES) by means of zonal isolation and its implementation in OpenFOAM package is carried out. A series of calculations of three-dimensional flow around an aircraft at angles of attack of 0 to 30 degree considering airbrake deflections on 60 degree are conducted. Flow separation at the airbrake side edges and upper edge result in a highly turbulent wake. The corresponding region of vortex flow affects the fin and causes buffet loads.},

@article{Colucci1998,
  abstract = {A methodology termed the 'fiItered mass density function' (FMDF) is developed and implemented for large-eddy simulation (LES) of variable-density chemically reacting turbulent hows at low Mach numbers. This methodology is based on the extension of the 'fiItered density function' (FDF) scheme recently proposed by Colucci et al. (1998) for LES of constant-density reacting flows. The FMDF represents the joint probability density function of the subgrid-scale (SGS) scalar quantities and is obtained by solution of its modelled transport equation. In this equation, the effect of chemical reactions appears in a closed form and the influences of SGS mixing and convection are modelled. The stochastic differential equations (SDEs) which yield statistically equivalent results to those of the FMDF transport equation are derived and are solved via a Lagrangian Monte Carlo scheme. The consistency, convergence, and accuracy of the FMDF and the Monte Carlo solution of its equivalent SDEs are assessed. In non-reacting flows, it is shown that the filtered results via the FMDF agree well with those obtained by the 'conventional' LES in which the finite difference solution of the transport equations of these filtered quantities is obtained. The advantage of the FMDF is demonstrated in LES of reacting shear flows with non-premixed reactants. The FMDF results are appraised by comparisons with data generated by direct numerical simulation (DNS) and with experimental measurements. In the absence of a closure for the SGS scalar correlations, the results based on the conventional LES are significantly different from those obtained by DNS. The FMDF results show a closer agreement with DNS. These results also agree favourably with laboratory data of exothermic reacting turbulent shear hows, and portray several of the features observed experimentally.},

@article{Lindstedt2002,
  abstract = {Methanol has potential as an alternative fuel due to favorable combustion properties that include lower emissions of particulates and oxides of nitrogen. Disadvantages include high miscibility with water and potential difficulties with emissions of oxygenated species. Theoretical investigations of methanol oxidation in practical (e.g., turbulent and/or multidimensional) flow fields require chemistry descriptions that balance thermochemical fidelity, compactness, and mathematical properties (e.g., stiffness). Recent studies of methane combustion in turbulent flames have shown, through the application of augmented (large scalar space) reduced reaction mechanisms, that accurate chemistry is a prerequisite for quantitative predictions of kinetically influenced phenomena. The latter include extinction/reignition and pollutant emissions. The present work extends past work on augmented reduced mechanisms to include methanol oxidation. The detailed and systematically reduced mechanisms are comprehensively validated against shock tube, flow reactor, premixed, and partially premixed flame data. It is shown that the detailed starting mechanism featuring 52 species and 326 reactions can be reduced to a 14-step mechanism for the C/H/O system and a 5-step submechanism for nitrogen-containing species without appreciable lack of generality.},

In order to study this and to gain further insight into LES, simulations of forced and decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence have been performed for Taylor Re numbers between 35 and 248 using various SGS models, representative of the contemporary state of the art. The predictive capability of the LES concept is analyzed by comparison with DNS data and with results obtained from a theoretical model of the energy spectrum. The resolved flow is examined by visualizing the morphology and by analyzing the distribution of resolved enstrophy, rate of strain, stretching, SGS kinetic energy, and viscosity. Furthermore, the correlation between eigenvalues of the resolved rate of strain tensor and the vorticity is investigated. Although the gross features of the flow appear independent of the SGS model, pronounced differences between the models become apparent when the SGS kinetic energy and the interscale energy transfer are investigated.},

METHODS: A total of 34 patients and age and body mass matched 20 healthy control subjects were included to this prospective study. Both of patients and control groups were consisted of normal oral glucose tolerance test. Insulin resistance (IR) was estimated using HOMA-IR method. CRP, lipid and hormone levels were measured. CIMT was measured by Carotid Artery B-Mode ultrasonography. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between patients and controls in BMI, and waist circumference, lipid, TSH, LH, FSH, estradiol, and prolactin levels. Serum insulin, testosterone, DHEAS, ferritin levels and HOMA values were significantly higher in patient group. We found that 64.7{\%} (n = 22/34) patients with PCOS had insulin resistance. Both of CIMT and CRP levels were significantly higher in the PCOS patients had BMI over 25 kg/m(2). CRP levels was significantly higher in the PCOS patients had waist circumference greater than 80 cm. CONCLUSION: We found insulin resistance in the women with PCOS even if OGTT was normal. Our data were similar to literature, the women with PCOS have increased risk of premature atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome.},

  abstract = {Sparse multiple mapping conditioning-large eddy simulation (MMC-LES) is applied for the first time to a flame involving swirl, thus extending the model to complex flow conditions that are more indicative of practical combustors than is the case for the jet flames simulated previously. Two cases from the University of Sydney swirl flame series are chosen: (i) non-reacting case N16S159 is simulated first to test the resolution of the unstructured mesh and boundary conditions; followed by (ii) methane-air swirl flame SMA2 which has the same flow boundary conditions as N16S159. MMC-LES is a filtered density function (FDF) approach and accurate emulation of the subfilter conditional fluctuations is sensitive to the modelling of the mixing time scale. Two models are tested: (i) the original mixing time scale model (C{\&}K model) proposed by Cleary and Klimenko (2011) and used in all past MMC-LES of laboratory flame cases, and (ii) a new, consistently anisotropic model (a-ISO model) proposed recently by Vo et al. (2017) and validated against direct numerical simulation (DNS) only. Overall, the swirl flow predictions are in very good agreement with the experimental data and both mixing time scale models produce similar statistical results for axial and azimuthal velocity, mixture fraction and unconditional reacting scalars including temperature and CO and OH mass fraction. While the predictions of conditional mean temperature show only a minor sensitivity to the mixing time scale selection, the a-ISO model produces significantly better results for the conditional fluctuations of temperature.},

The spray is simulated with a Lagrangian droplet transport and a stochastic breakup model together with finite rate heat and mass transfer models. The droplet transport, breakup, wake, collision/coalescence, heat transfer and evaporation models are used together with a compressible gas phase LES solver for numerical simulations of high pressure liquid jets sprayed into a high temperature and pressure gas chamber. The numerical results are compared with the available experimental results for global spray variables such as the spray penetration length. Various non-evaporating and evaporating sprays at different ambient gas pressures and temperatures are considered. In all cases, the gas velocity and turbulence generated by the spray are found to be very significant. A broad spectrum of droplet sizes is also generated by the complex and coupled effects of the gas flow turbulence, droplet breakup and evaporation. Droplet wake interactions are shown to be important to the spray evolution. The effect of subgrid turbulence model on the global spray parameters, like the spray penetration, is also shown to be significant at lower gas temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The data are available for DME/air mixtures diluted with 40{\%} CO2 as well as for the mixture of DME and oxidizer containing 20.5{\%} O2 and 79.5{\%} CO2. As a reference, data were also collected for mixtures containing the corresponding amounts of N2. Measurements were conducted for pressures of 15, 35, and 50 bar and a range of temperatures (744–1316 K). For the DME/air mixture diluted with CO2, the equivalence ratio was varied in the range of 0.5–2.0. The results demonstrate that CO2 dilution has a strong effect on ignition delay times in the NTC (negative temperature coefficient) region. The kinetic study that was conducted showed that this phenomenon can be attributed to a thermal effect resulting from the high heat capacity of CO2. In low and high temperature ranges, the effect of CO2 is less pronounced. Additionally, a chemical effect was identified. At high temperatures this effect can be attributed mostly to the influence of CO2 on third-body reactions and leads to slight acceleration of ignition. Various chemical-kinetic models available were evaluated with respect to their accuracy in prediction of ignition delay times for mixtures containing DME and large amounts of CO2.},

The droplet source terms in the mean and variance of the mixture fraction equation were also modelled. For comparison, simulations without droplet source terms in the CMC equations were also carried out. The air velocity field and droplet size were compared with experimental data and good agreement was found. The flame expansion process following ignition compared qualitatively with fast-camera images from the experiment and the overall flame shape and speed were captured satisfactorily. Comparisons of conditional temperature at different locations in the flow field gives further insight on how the additional droplet evaporation source terms affect the flow field.

  abstract = {Aspects of interphase transport and multiphase flow relevant to spray combustion are reviewed, considering the structure of the near-injector (dense-spray) region, drop breakup, drop/turbulence interactions and interphase drop transport. Existing measurements of dense-spray structure shown that the dispersedflow flow region is surprisingly dilute, that effects of separated flow are important, that atomization involves primary breakup at the liquid surface followed by secondary breakup, and that effects of drop collisions are small (except when sprays impinge on surfaces or on other sprays). Available information about primary breakup is difficult to interpret because of problems controlling effects of disturbances in injector passages and secondary breakup; therefore, although some understanding of turbulent primary breakup has been achieved, more information about aerodynamic primary breakup is needed to address practical spray combustion processes. Studies of secondary breakup have resolved aspects of breakup regimes and outcomes, including the temporal properties of secondary breakup in some instances, for shock-wave disturbances at small gas/liquid density ratios and liquid viscosities; thus, more information is needed about general drop disturbances and the large gas/liquid density ratio and liquid viscosity condition relevant to spray combustion at high pressures. Several ways to treat the turbulent dispersion of drops within dilute sprays are available. Consequently, the main uncertainties about estimating turbulent dispersion of drops involvelong-standing problems of accurately estimating continuous-phase turbulence properties in sprays. Phenomena that complicate estimates of turbulence properties in sprays include turbulence generation and modulation by drops, with turbulence generation being a dominant but retely studied reature of dense sprays. Understanding of drop evaporation and combustion has increased based on results from numerical simulations allowing for variable properties, multicomponent transport, and detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms; these methods offer promising new ways to study drop ignition, extinction, transport, and behavior near the thermodynamic critical point, among others.},

  abstract = {Diesel spray modelling still remains a challenge, especially in the dense near-nozzle region. This region is difficult to experimentally access and also to model due to the complex and rapid liquid and gas interaction. Modelling approaches based on Lagrangian particle tracking have struggled in this area, while Eulerian modelling has proven particularly useful. An interesting approach is the single-fluid diffuse interface model known as $\Sigma$-Y, based on scale separation assumptions at high Reynolds and Weber numbers. Liquid dispersion is modelled as turbulent mixing of a variable density flow. The concept of surface area density is used for representing liquid structures, regardless of the complexity of the interface. In this work, an implementation of the $\Sigma$-Y model in the OpenFOAM CFD library is applied to simulate the ECN Spray A in the near nozzle region, using both RANS and LES turbulence modelling. Assessment is performed with measurements conducted at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). The ultra-small-angle x-ray scattering (USAXS) technique has been used to measure the interfacial surface area, and x-ray radiography to measure the fuel dispersion, allowing a direct evaluation of the $\Sigma$-Y model predictions.},

  abstract = {ISSN: 0010-2202 (Print) 1563-521X (Online) Journal homepage: http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/gcst20 Abstract—A Monte Carlo method is presented which simulates the transport equations of joint probability density functions (pdf's) in turbulent flows. (Finite-difference solutions of the equations are impracticable, mainly because of the large dimensionality of the pdf's). Attention is focused on an equation for the joint pdf of chemical and thermodynamic properties in turbulent reactive flows. It is shown that the Monte Carlo method provides a true simulation of this equation, and that the amount of computation required increases only linearly with the number of properties considered. Consequently, the method can be used to solve the pdf equation for turbulent flows involving many chemical species and complex reaction kinetics. Test calcu-lations are reported that demonstrate the method and determine the influence of the numerical parameters. The method is then used to calculate pdf's of temperature in a turbulent mixing layer, and the calculations are found to be in good agreement with the measurements of Batt (1977). The method has previously been used to calculate the joint pdf of three reactive species in a premixed flame (Pope, 1981a).},

@book{Grosshans2013a,
  abstract = {Liquid-gas two-phase flows occur frequently in daily life, in nature e.g. falling rain drops or waves in the sea, and in industrial applications, e.g. fuel injection in Diesel engines or gas turbines. For many of these applications the interaction between liquid and gas is crucial for their efficient operation. In this work liquid-gas interaction is studied numerically, specifically for atomizing flows. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) are performed to obtain time-dependent results. The disintegration of a liquid jet and the formation of small spherical droplets is simulated using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. The development of liquid sprays, the breakup into smaller droplets, the evaporation and mixing with the surrounding gas is simulated using the Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) method. This thesis focuses a) on improving the understanding of the underlying physics and b) improving the numerical modelling techniques of atomizing two-phase flows. Concerning physics of two-phase flows, it is studied how variations of the liquid properties, such as density, viscosity or surface tension influence the primary breakup of the liquid jet, the spray development and the liquid-gas mixing. It is shown how viscosity and surface tension stabilise the liquid structures, while higher liquid density leads to faster liquid breakup. Also pulsed injection and its effect on primary breakup and the spray development is studied. The formation of a entrainment wave is indicated which propagates faster than the jet itself and enhances liquid-gas mixing. Concerning numerical modelling of two-phase flows, a novel method is developed to couple a VOF simulation of the jet atomization with a LPT simulation of a dispersed spray. The method is based on a statistical coupling which shows to be accurate and to improve significantly the computational efficiency compared to existing VOF-LPT coupling methods. Also, a novel approach to correlate spray data obtained from measurements to numerically obtained spray data is proposed. Instead of only global spray parameters, a complete field of a variable, the light extinction coefficient, is compared.},

Heat and mass transfer between the gaseous and liquid phases is modelled using a conserved scalar form of the Spalding transfer number approach along with an evaporative mixing model that is local in mixture fraction space. The model and the numerical implementation are tested in a non-reacting and two reacting experimental acetone spray cases. Model predictions are generally in good agreement with the velocity, liquid volume flow rate and mean temperature data and are shown to have a low sensitivity to the sparse stochastic particle resolution. The consistency of the heat and mass transfer coupling between the hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian–Lagrangian schemes is demonstrated by comparison of mixture fraction fields solved on both the LES and the stochastic particles. A comprehensive appendix contains a derivation of the phase-weighted form of the MMC–LES governing equations along with a derivation and single-droplet test of the conserved scalar heat and mass transfer formulation.},

  abstract = {Combustion generated noise of a turbulent spray flame has been investigated using a hybrid Computational Fluid Dynamics/Computational Aero-Acoustics (CFD/CAA) framework. In this two-step framework, the reacting flow-field of a flame is simulated using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) in the first step, while the acoustic wave propagation in a non-uniform mean flow is captured by solving the Acoustic Perturbation Equations extended to Reacting Flows (APE-RF) in the second step. The numerical approach used in this study is therefore, termed as the hybrid DNS/APE-RF approach. First, this hybrid DNS/APE-RF approach is used to simulate a benchmark experimental open turbulent non-premixed flame, and the results obtained for the non-premixed flame's flow-field statistical quantities, as well as radiated sound intensities are extensively validated against experimental data. Next, the hybrid DNS/APE-RF approach is applied to an experimental open turbulent spray flame, for simulating its two-phase reacting flow-field along with its combustion generated acoustic field, to predict and analyze the noise radiation behavior. The DNS results of the spray flame are compared with measurements, in terms of droplet velocity statistics and gas-phase temperatures, and favorable agreement is observed. The computed acoustic power spectra of the spray flame exhibit a power law dependence of the form f−2.4 (where f is the frequency) in the frequency range 300 Hz {\textless} f {\textless} 1000 Hz. And, the computed noise spectra of the spray flame contain a nearly constant sound pressure level plateau, for frequencies greater than 1000 Hz and up to 3000 Hz. Acoustic refraction effects induced by sound speed variations in the flame, resulting in the attenuation of high-frequency noise radiated in the flame downstream direction, are also captured in the simulation. Noise radiation characteristics of the turbulent spray flame are found to resemble those of turbulent premixed and non-premixed flames.},

  abstract = {Molecular diffusion effects in LES of a piloted methane-air (Sandia D) flame are investigated on a series of grids with progressively increased resolution. The reacting density, temperature and chemical composition are modeled based on the mixture fraction approach combined with a steady flamelet model. With a rationale to minimize interpolation uncertainties that are routinely introduced by a flamelet table look-up, quadratic splines relationships are employed to represent thermochemical variables. The role of molecular diffusivity in effecting spatial transport is studied by drawing a comparison with the turbulent diffusivity and analyzing their statistics conditioned on temperature. Statistical results demonstrate that the molecular diffusivity in the near-field almost always exceeds the turbulent diffusivity, except at low temperatures (less than 500. K). Thus, by altering the jet near-field, molecular transport plays an important role in the further downstream jet development. Molecular diffusivity continues to dominate in the centerline region throughout the flow field. Overall, the results suggest the strong necessity to represent molecular transport accurately in LES studies of turbulent reacting flows. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Combustion Institute.},

This is followed by an exposition on the various methods of derivation for the CMC equation and the general characteristics of this equation and its boundary conditions. Simplifications that can be made in slender layer flows such as jets and plumes are outlined and examples of application of the technique to such flows are given. The method allows the definition of a new class of simplified reactors related to the well known perfectly stirred reactor and plug flow reactor: these are outlined. CMC predictions are compared to experiment and direct numerical simulations for flows with homogeneous turbulence. Derivation and modeling of the equations for conditional variances and covariances are outlined and their use in second-order CMC illustrated.

  abstract = {A swirling ethanol spray flame in conditions close to blow-off has been simulated using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and the Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) combustion model aiming to further validate the capability of the LES/CMC approach to capture local extinctions in turbulent spray flames. A detailed chemical mechanism was used and a transport equation of the mixture fraction sub-grid variance, with spray interaction terms included, was solved. Numerical results are in good agreement with the experiment in terms of both instantaneous and mean flame shape and droplet velocity and size. Local extinctions were detected in the region around the bluff-body, resulting in a fluctuating lift-off of the flame there, and the probability density function of the lift-off height was in very good agreement with the experiment, suggesting that the degree of local extinction is captured quantitatively. Analysis of the CMC equation suggested that local extinction was influenced by both transport in physical space and high scalar dissipation rate. The modelling of the latter needs development in areas where the spray evaporation is strong enough to increase significantly the sub-grid mixture fraction fluctuations and their small-scale gradients, possibly leading to deviations from the present usual approach of relating the sub-grid scalar dissipation to the sub-grid mixture fraction variance.},

  abstract = {This work presents an implementation and evaluation of the $\Sigma$-Y atomization model for Diesel spray CFD simulations. The $\Sigma$-Y model is based on an Eulerian representation of the spray atomization and dispersion by means of a single-fluid variable density turbulent flow within a RANS framework. The locally homogeneous flow approach has been applied in order to develop a spray vaporization model based on state relationships. A finite-volume solver for model equations has been created using the OpenFOAM CFD open-source C++ library. Model predictions have been compared to experimental data from free Diesel sprays under nonvaporizing and vaporizing conditions. High-speed imaging, PDPA, and Rayleigh-scattering measurements have been used in order to assess the CFD model. Accurate predictions of liquid and vapor spray penetration, as well as axial velocity and mixture fraction profiles, can be simultaneously achieved for a wide range of injection pressure and ambient conditions, despite only having qualitatively correct predictions of droplet size. The success of these predictions supports the mixing-limited vaporization hypothesis. Model accuracy is better for high ambient density and injection pressure conditions. It is proposed that under low ambient density and injection pressure conditions, interfacial dynamics become more important and the single velocity field assumption is less appropriate. {\textcopyright} 2013 by Begell House, Inc.},

  abstract = {We review the significant progress that has been made in the development and use of turbulent combustion models applicable to practical combustion devices. Recent work has focused on the development of methods that can treat finite-rate kinetics in a realistic yet tractable way, so that local extinction and related phenomena can be studied. Direct numerical simulation cannot be used for this purpose, because it is computationally intractable; and the potential of large-eddy simulation is far from clear because combustion reactions give rise to a severe closure problem. PDF methods, on the other hand, overcome the major closure problems, and they have been shown to be tractable for complex flows and with realistic finite-rate kinetics. A simple explanation of pdf methods is presented. It is shown that the single modelled equation for the joint pdf of velocity, dissipation and composition provides a closure for turbulent combustion. Reaction and convection are treated exactly, while the modelling is performed in a Lagrangian setting, by constructing deterministic or stochastic models for the evolution of fluid-particle properties. Examples of recent pdf calculations are described, including those based on four-step mechanisms for methane. Extension of pdf methods to include composition gradients is discussed, with a view to improving the modelling of molecular diffusion.},

  abstract = {An experiment was performed to study ethanol spray flames in conditions similar to those arising in industrial flameless oxidation devices. Special emphasis was placed on creating a wide and homogeneous hot-diluted co-flow so that numerical simulations complexity is minimized. The studied ethanol spray flames are weakly luminescent, transparent and stable. Gas and dispersed-phase properties of five flames with different co-flow conditions (O2 volume fractions of 6.5-9.8{\%}) and liquid mass flows (1.36-1.62 kg/hr) were investigated using Phase Doppler Anemometry. It was found that the center region of the spray consists of small droplets. Large droplets are found in the outer regions. Increasing liquid mass flows leads to an increase of droplet average velocity and small Sauter mean diameter. With increasing co-flow enthalpy, enhanced vaporization rates take place, the core quickly gets void of droplets and an ignitable mixture fraction is achieved yielding lower lift-off heights. The high gas-phase turbulence levels show that although visually look laminar-like they are considerable turbulent.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging of CH2O and OH was performed at a repetition rate of 10.kHz, jointly with chemiluminescence to explore autoigniting dimethyl ether (DME) flames in a hot vitiated coflow burner. The focus of the study is the imaging of the flame stabilization region and the temporal evolution of ignition kernels upstream of the flame base. Results detail the evolution of kernels throughout their formation, growth and final merging with the flame base. The ignition events were explored for a range of different fuel premixing and dilution ratios over two coflow temperatures which result in different lift-off heights. Images of CH2O and OH over the entire flame length show that not only is the lift-off height much higher at low coflow temperatures, but that the fluctuations are more intense and the region of kernel formation is larger both radially and axially. In these autoignition stabilized flames, increased premixing leads to the lift-off height and location of the maximum kernel formation rate being further downstream. Transient 1-D simulations of hot coflow products opposed against jet fuel mixtures identify that the overlap of CH2O and OH PLIF signals are a reliable marker of heat release in autoignition kernels. Measurements indicate that for the high coflow temperature cases, on average, the heat release of individual kernels is low, despite the high total kernel formation rate. This can be correlated to the slow growth rate and elongated aspect ratio of the kernels. For low coflow temperature cases, kernels are growing faster and have high heat release rates with near unity aspect ratios.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional n-heptane spray flames in a swirl combustor are investigated by means of direct numerical simulation (DNS) to provide insight into realistic spray evaporation and combustion as well as relevant modeling issues. The variable-density, low-Mach number Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a fully conservative and kinetic energy conserving finite difference scheme in cylindrical coordinates. Dispersed droplets are tracked in a Lagrangian framework. Droplet evaporation is described by an equilibrium model. Gas combustion is represented using an adaptive one-step irreversible reaction. Two different cases are studied: a lean case that resembles a lean direct injection combustion, and a rich case that represents the primary combustion region of a rich-burn/quick-quench/lean-burn combustor. The results suggest that premixed combustion contribute more than 70{\%} to the total heat release rate, although diffusion flame have volumetrically a higher contribution. The conditional mean scalar dissipation rate is shown to be strongly influenced, especially in the rich case. The conditional mean evaporation rate increases almost linearly with mixture fraction in the lean case, but shows a more complex behavior in the rich case. The probability density functions (PDF) of mixture fraction in spray combustion are shown to be quite complex. To model this behavior, the formulation of the PDF in a transformed mixture fraction space is proposed and demonstrated to predict the DNS data reasonably well. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Combustion Institute.

@article{Demoulin2013,
  abstract = {His paper focuses on the use of direct numerical simulation (DNS) in the context of spray atomization modeling. Key features of such liquid/gas simulations, which are necessary for confidence in model accuracy, are recalled and discussed together with their inherent limitations. Particular attention is given to the lack of theories relating to the determination of the smallest length scale in turbulent liquid-gas flows. To demonstrate how direct numerical simulation can serve modeling purposes, this paper discusses three major areas of possible applications of DNS. First, DNS databases were created to validate modeling approaches in flow areas where no experimental measurements are available. In this paper, this approach is applied to diesel injection conditions to validate the Eulerian-Lagrangian spray atomization (ELSA) model. Second, because models are necessary to mitigate computational costs, which constitute the main drawback of DNS, this paper proposes the development of a large eddy simulation formulation of the liquid atomization, thereby enabling results that are no longer mesh resolution dependent. Finally, once the large scale is correctly captured, it is necessary to ensure an accurate representation of the liquid structure falling below the subgrid scale. To this end, a source term for the surface density equation is established based on direct numerical simulations of liquid-gas flows embedded in an isotropic turbulence and covering both dense and moderately dense ranges. ? 2013 by Begell House, Inc.},

  abstract = {Large-eddy simulation of an evaporating isopropyl alcohol spray in a coaxial combustor is performed. The Favre-averaged, variable density, low-Mach number Navier-Stokes equations are solved on unstructured grids with dynamic subgrid scale model to compute the turbulent gas-phase. The original incompressible flow algorithm for LES on unstructured grids by [Mahesh et al., J. Comp. Phys. 197 (2004) 215–240] is extended to include density variations and droplet evaporation. An efficient particle-tracking scheme on unstructured meshes is developed to compute the dispersed phase. Experimentally measured droplet size distribution and size-velocity correlation near the nozzle exit are used as the inlet conditions for the spray. The predictive capability of the LES approach on unstructured grids together with Lagrangian droplet dynamics models to capture the droplet dispersion characteristics, size distributions, and the spray evolution is examined in detail. The mean and turbulent quantities for the gas and particle phases are compared to experimental data to show good agreement. It is shown that for low evaporation rates considered in the present study, a well resolved large-eddy simulation together with simple subgrid models for droplet evaporation and motion provides good agreement of the mean and turbulent quantities for the gas and droplet phases compared to the experimental data. This work represents an important first step to assess the predictive capability of the unstructured grid LES approach applied to spray vaporization. The novelty of the results presented is that they establish a baseline fidelity in the ability to simulate complex flows on unstructured grids at conditions representative of gas-turbine combustors.},

Combust. Flame 162(3), 759–773, 2015). A “Lagrangian-Lagrangian” approach is adopted where both the joint velocity-scalar Probability Density Function (PDF) for the continuous phase and the joint PDF of droplet properties are modeled and solved. The evolution of the gas phase composition is described by a Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) and the interaction by exchange with the mean (IEM) micro-mixing model. Effects of finite conductivity on droplet heating and evaporation are accounted for. The inlet boundary conditions starting in the dilute spray region are obtained from the available experimental data together with the results of a calculation of the spray including the dense region using ANSYS Fluent 15. A method is developed to determine a good estimation for the initial droplet temperature. The inclusion of the “1/3” rule for droplet evaporation and dispersion models is shown to be very important. The current modeling approach is capable of accurately predicting main properties, including mean velocity, droplet mean diameter and number density. The gas temperature is under-predicted in the region where the enthalpy loss due to droplet evaporation is important. The flame structure analysis reveals the existence of two heat release regions, respectively having the characteristics of a premixed and a diffusion flame. The experimental and modeled temperature PDFs are compared, highlighting the capabilities and limitations of the proposed model.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study on the formation of diffusion flame islands in a hydrogen jet lifted flame. A real size hydrogen jet lifted flame is numerically simulated by the DNS approach over a period of about 0.5 ms. The diameter of hydrogen injector is 2 mm, and the injection velocity is 680 m/s. The lifted flame is composed of a stable leading edge flame, a vigorously turbulent inner rich premixed flame, and a number of outer diffusion flame islands. The relatively long-term observation makes it possible to understand in detail the time-dependent flame behavior in rather large time scales, which are as large as the time scale of the leading edge flame unsteadiness. From the observation, the following three findings are obtained concerning the formation of diffusion flame islands. (1) A thin oxygen diffusion layer is developed along the outer boundary of the lifted flame, where the diffusion flame islands burn in a rather flat shape. (2) When a diffusion flame island comes into contact with the fluctuating inner rich premixed flame, combustion is intensified due to an increase in the hydrogen supply by molecular diffusion. This process also works for the production of the diffusion flame islands in the oxygen diffusion layer. (3) When a large unburned gas volume penetrates into the leading edge flame, the structure of the leading edge flame changes. In this transformation process, a diffusion flame island comes near the leading edge flame. The local deficiency of oxygen plays an important role in this production process.},

For this purpose, two bi-orifices nozzle geometries, a cylindrical nozzle and a convergent one, are characterized by means of two fundamental spray parameters: mass flux and momentum flux. Five injection pressure values and five discharge pressure levels have been measured in order to change the cavitation regime inside the nozzle flow. It is known from the literature that cavitation brings about a mass flux choke, but there are few studies that investigate its effects on momentum and outlet velocity in real geometries. The key point of this study is the measurement of spray momentum in order to explain the effects of nozzle geometry on spray behavior. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The chirped-probe pulse technique offers one of the shortest integration times of any laser diagnostic technique – appx. 3 ps, and excellent spatial resolution – appx. 1 mm along beam propagation and 75 m in the transverse dimension. This paper outlines the current work, applying this technique to the two-phase combustion environment in a liquid-fuel spray burner. The research collaboration presented here involves fs CPP CARS measurements in a dilute spray flame of ethanol. This paper presents results from two flame cases: one premixed methane-air flame and one ethanol dilute spray flame. Time-averaged temperature profiles as well as temperature time-histories are presented for both flames. Sources of measurement error are discussed relating to the interference of the methane signal with the nitrogen signal and relating to liquid droplets passing through the laser probe volume. The 5 kHz data acquisition rate was rapid enough to capture smoothly-varying temperature profiles for all but the most turbulent regions. The buildup and decay of temperature oscillatory structures was observed at the flame-coflow boundary in both flames and is discussed. Continuing research is aimed at the expansion of this data set into more complex spray flames of intermediate density.

  abstract = {This paper deals with the influence of flow regime (laminar, transition or turbulent) on the internal flow behavior, and how it affects the spray development in diesel nozzles. In particular, the research described here aims at studying and quantifying the internal flow regime effects on the spray behavior. With this purpose, internal flow results, based on mass flow rate and momentum flux measurements performed on three different tapered nozzles and which helped to determine the flow regime, has been taken into account as a point of departure for the spray behavior analysis. Thus, in this work, spray macroscopic visualization tests have been performed and analyzed which clearly revealed a change in the behavior of the angle and penetration of the spray related to the change of the flow nature. Moreover, with all the experimental data available, it has been possible to relate macroscopic parameters of the spray with those describing the internal flow (momentum and effective velocity) or the geometry of the nozzle (length or diameter) through correlations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {A fully compressible direct numerical simulation flow and combustion solver (S3D) is modified and turned into a Large-eddy simulation (LES) solver. In this study, Favre- averaged governing equations are formulated first, supplemented with the classical Smagorinsky model and the dynamic procedure. To simulate low-Mach number flows, the speed of sound is artificially reduced while preserving the zero-Mach number physics. This pseudo-compressibility method is called Acoustic Speed Reduction (ASR). With ASR, the code has the capability to compute low-Mach number flows in an efficient way. The boundary conditions in S3DLES are based on a one-dimensional characteristic analysis. To stabilize the solution, a buffer layer treatment is introduced at outflow boundaries to reduce acoustic reflections. The resulting flow is stable and produces results that compare well with a reference study. The implementation of the Smagorinsky model and other sub-models are validated using published plane jet simulation results with well-defined flow and perturbation conditions.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 The Author(s). Published by Taylor  {\&}  Francis. In the present study two benchmark problems for turbulent dispersed particle-laden flow are investigated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). How the CFD programs OpenFOAM and ANSYS FLUENT model these flows is tested and compared. The numerical results obtained with Lagrangian-Eulerian (LE) point-particle (PP) models for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of the fluid flow in steady state and transient modes are compared with the experimental data available in the literature. The effect of the dispersion model on the particle motion is investigated in particular, as well as the order of coupling between the continuous carrier phase and the dispersed phase. First, a backward-facing step (BFS) case is validated. As a second case, the confined bluff body (CBB) is used. The simulated fluid flows correspond well with the experimental data for both test cases. The results for the dispersed solid phase reveal a good accordance between the simulation results and the experiments. It seems that particle dispersion is slightly under-predicted when ANSYS FLUENT is used, whereas the applied solver in OpenFOAM overestimates the dispersion somewhat. Only minor differences between the coupling schemes are detected due to the low volume fractions and mass loadings that are investigated. In the BFS test case the importance of the spatial dimension of the numerical model is demonstrated. Even if it is reasonable to assume a two-dimensional fluid flow structure, it is crucial to simulate the turbulent particle-laden flow with a three-dimensional model since the turbulent dispersion of the particles is three-dimensional.},

@article{Gordon2007a,
  abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study of auto-ignition in simple jets of a hydrogen-nitrogen mixture issuing into a vitiated co-flowing stream. The stabilization region of these flames is complex and, depending on the flow conditions, may undergo a transition from auto-ignition to premixed flame propagation. The objective of this paper is to develop numerical indicators for identifying such behavior, first in well-known simple test cases and then in the lifted turbulent flames. The calculations employ a composition probability density function (PDF) approach coupled to the commercial CFD code, FLUENT. The in-situ-adaptive tabulation (ISAT) method is used to implement detailed chemical kinetics. A simple k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model is used for turbulence along with a low Reynolds number model close to the solid walls of the fuel pipe. The first indicator is based on an analysis of the species transport with respect to the budget of convection, diffusion and chemical reaction terms. This is a powerful tool for investigating aspects of turbulent combustion that would otherwise be prohibitive or impossible to examine experimentally. Reaction balanced by convection with minimal axial diffusion is taken as an indicator of auto-ignition while a diffusive-reactive balance, preceded by a convective-diffusive balanced pre-heat zone, is representative of a premixed flame. The second indicator is the relative location of the onset of creation of certain radical species such as HO2 ahead of the flame zone. The buildup of HO2 prior to the creation of H, O and OH is taken as another indicator of autoignition. The paper first confirms the relevance of these indicators with respect to two simple test cases representing clear auto-ignition and premixed flame propagation. Three turbulent lifted flames are then investigated and the presence of auto-ignition is identified. These numerical tools are essential in providing valuable insights into the stabilization behaviour of these flames, and the demarcation between processes of auto-ignition and premixed flame propagation.},

@article{Xie2008,
  abstract = {Using a numerical weather forecasting code to provide the dynamic large-scale inlet boundary conditions for the computation of small-scale urban canopy flows requires a continuous specification of appropriate inlet turbulence. For such computations to be practical, a very efficient method of generating such turbulence is needed. Correlation functions of typical turbulent shear flows have forms not too dissimilar to decaying exponentials. A digital-filter-based generation of turbulent inflow conditions exploiting this fact is presented as a suitable technique for large eddy simulations computation of spatially developing flows. The artificially generated turbulent inflows satisfy the prescribed integral length scales and Reynolds-stress-tensor. The method is much more efficient than, for example, Klein's (J Comp Phys 186:652-665, 2003) or Kempf et al.'s (Flow Turbulence Combust, 74:67-84, 2005) methods because at every time step only one set of two-dimensional (rather than three-dimensional) random data is filtered to generate a set of two-dimensional data with the appropriate spatial correlations. These data are correlated with the data from the previous time step by using an exponential function based on two weight factors. The method is validated by simulating plane channel flows with smooth walls and flows over arrays of staggered cubes (a generic urban-type flow). Mean velocities, the Reynolds-stress-tensor and spectra are all shown to be comparable with those obtained using classical inlet-outlet periodic boundary conditions. Confidence has been gained in using this method to couple weather scale flows and street scale computations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Different flame regimes are identified with a flame index defined by budget terms in a 2-D multi-phase flamelet formulation, and the application in LES of partially pre-vaporized spray flames shows a favorable agreement with experiments. Simulations demonstrate that, compared to the conventional single-regime flamelets, the present partially premixed flamelet formulation shows its ability in capturing the subgrid regime transitions, yielding a well prediction of peak gas temperature and the downstream flame spreading. A propagating premixed flame front is found coupled with a trailing diffusion burning through the spray evaporation, and the spray effect on regime discrimination is manifested with transport budget analysis. A two-phase regime indicator is then proposed, by which the evaporation-dictated regime is properly described. Its intended use will rely on both gas and spray flamelet structures.},

@article{Honhar2017,
  abstract = {The present study concerns the investigation of different mixing models for use in the transported probability density function (PDF) modeling of turbulent (reacting) spray flows. The modeling of the turbulent mixing and other characteristic scalar variables such as gas enthalpy using transported (joint) PDFs has become an important method to describe turbulent (reacting) spray flows since the evaporation process causes the PDF of the mixture fraction to deviate from the widely used $\beta$ function, which is typically used in models for turbulent gas flows. In the PDF transport equation, the molecular mixing does not appear in closed form so that modeling strategies are required. For gas combustion, the interaction-by-exchange-with-the-mean (IEM) model, the modified Curl (MC) model, and the Euclidean minimum spanning tree (EMST) models are used. More recently, a new mixing model, the PSP model, which is based on parameterized scalar profiles has been developed. The present study focuses on the use and analysis of the IEM, MC and PSP models for turbulent spray flames. For this purpose, the models are reconsidered with respect to the evaporation process that must be included and evaluated if spray combustion is considered. For model evaluation, turbulent ethanol/air spray flames are simulated, and the results are compared to experimental data by A. Masri, University of Sydney, Australia.},

Particular attention is focused on the modeling of the particle Lagrangian velocity increment, especially, but not exclusively, in the case in which only the low frequencies of the carrier turbulent flow field are available. The need for suitable models arises in the simulation of particle laden flows by the means of new computational techniques such as large-eddy simulation. For this, stochastic differential equations, sde, are often introduced, though there is a lack of clarity in how such models should deal with the experimental observed far from Gaussian statistics, intermittency, and heavy tailed probability density function for particle acceleration. It is well known that Langevin-type equations are not capable of reproducing such features. It is first shown how the stochastic model for the particle Lagrangian velocity increments is far from being a Langevin equation, and it is characterized by nonlinear drift and diffusion; the statistical characteristics of this first model are shown to be in qualitative agreement with experimental findings. These results suggest an improved model for the particle dynamics based upon a more general family of nonlinear sde; the family, which is generated by a single parameter, includes both the Langevin equation and the first model as special cases. An analysis of the statistical properties of the new sde shows that the model is capable of accurately reproducing the strong deviations from Gaussianity observed in recent experiments.

  abstract = {Flamelet theories are examined in the context of turbulent nonpremixed combustion. The criterion requiring that the reaction zone be thinner than the Kolmogoroff length scale is converted to one in which the range of mixture fraction over which reaction occurs is compared with the scalar scale for the small scale fluctuations. It is found that the criterion is violated in many of the flames of interest, particularly away from the nozzle in jet flames and in recirculating flows. Laser imaging data for scalar mixing is used to illustrate the structure of quasi-equilibrium distributed reaction (QEDR) flames at high Damkohler number. The structure is found to tend toward that of the scalar dissipation. The apparent success of flamelet theories in predicting mean concentrations of CO in hydrocarbon flames is ascribed to the metastable equilibrium of rich mixtures arising from chain terminating reactions of radicals with the fuel. Differences in flame structure for piloted jet diffusion flames near extinction of methane and CO/H2/N2 fuels are discussed in terms of these fluid dynamic and kinetic insights.},

  abstract = {A new approach to chemistry modeling for large eddy simulation of turbulent react- ing flows is developed. Instead of solving transport equations for all of the numerous species in a typical chemical mechanism and modeling the unclosed chemical source terms, the present study adopts an indirect mapping approach, whereby all of the detailed chemical processes are mapped to a reduced system of tracking scalars. Presently, only two such scalars are considered: a mixture fraction variable, which tracks the mixing of fuel and oxidizer, and a progress variable, which tracks the global extent-of-reaction of the local mixture. The mapping functions, which de- scribe all of the detailed chemical processes with respect to the tracking variables, are determined by solving quasi-steady diffusion-reaction equations with complex chemical kinetics and multicomponent mass diffusion. The performance of the new model is compared to fast chemistry and steady flamelet models for predicting ve- locity, species concentration, and temperature fields in a methane-fueled coaxial jet combustor for which experimental data are available. The progress-variable approach is able to capture the unsteady, lifted flame dynamics observed in the experiment, and to obtain good agreement with the experimental data and sig- nificantly outperform the fast chemistry and steady flamelet models, which both predict an attached flame. –},

  abstract = {The present understanding of spray combustion in rocket engine, gas turbine, Diesel engine and industrial furnace applications is reviewed. In some cases, spray combustion can be modeled by ignoring the details of spray evaporation and treating the system as a gaseous diffusion flame; however, in many circumstances, this simplification is not adequate and turbulent two-phase flow must be considered. The behavior of individual droplets is a necessary component of two-phase models and recent work on transient droplet evaporation, ignition and combustion is considered, along with a discusssion of important simplifying assumptions involved with modeling these processes. Methods of modeling spray evaporation and combustion processes are also discussed including: one-dimensional models for rocket engine and prevaporized combustion systems, lumped zone models (utilizing well-stirred reactor and plug flow regions) for gas turbine and furnace systems, locally homogeneous turbulent models, and two-phase models. The review highlights the need for improved injector characterization methods, more information of droplet transport characteristics in turbulent flow and continued development of more complete two-phase turbulent models.

  abstract = {Partially premixed spray flames are simulated with flamelet-based tabulated chemistry parameterized by the mixture fraction and progress variable. The transport equation of the reaction progress variable C is reconsidered, and its formulation for the reacting two-phase flows is derived and employed, which allows the inclusion of spray impacts through a new spray source term that is absent in its gaseous form. Both the nonpremixed and premixed flamelets assuming single reaction regime are implemented in LES, and their validities in spray flames and dependence on the evaporation effect when considering two-phase C equation are examined. The effect of spray, reaction and turbulence interaction is then investigated in comparison with experiments of Sydney reacting acetone sprays, covering the rich, lean and stoichiometric cases. The computed results generally follow the experimental data, but a disagreement between two flamelet simulations is observed especially in rich and lean flames. The premixed flamelets tend to capture the downstream jet spreading while overestimating the peak temperature compared to the nonpremixed chemistry. Flame index analysis indicates that in the present spray flames an evaporation-dominated regime exists inside the upstream core jet and it promotes the coexistence of subsequent interacting premixed and nonpremixed reaction zones, which impedes accurate flame prediction by the single regime flamelets. Furthermore, the spray source term appearing in the derived C equation is identified to act as scalar fluxes driven by sprays in flamelet structures. Including this new source term is found to be important to account for the dissipation effect induced by evaporation on the reaction zone in the flamelet simulation of turbulent spray flames.},

  abstract = {A laboratory scale experimental setup was built to study ethanol pressure-swirl spray flames in a coflow of either air or hot-diluted oxidant. The latter case resembles conditions similar to those found in practical combustion systems of liquid fuels operating in MILD conditions.First, experiments have been performed to investigate the phenomena associated with the atomization process. High-speed visualizations show that in the presence of a hot-diluted coflow, an almost immediate disruption of the liquid jet takes place, indicating significant changes in the atomization mechanism, compared to the case with air coflow. Secondly, a comprehensive set of measurements was obtained by complementary single-point measurement techniques to reveal the gas and droplets flow fields as well as temperature fields. Measurements of droplet size and velocity components in the spray region were obtained by phase Doppler anemometry. Gas temperature was measured using coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy even in regions with droplet density as high as 105cm-3. It has been observed that in a reacting spray in air coflow, an inner and an outer flame-front are present. For a reacting spray with similar injection pressure in hot-diluted coflow, weakening of the inner flame-front is attributed to the fact that the gaseous mixture becomes increasingly rich towards the center region. Consequently, a significant reduction of occurrence of temperature samples above 2000K is observed throughout most of the spray region.},

An Eulerian description of the flow is adopted, while the behavior of the discrete liquid phase is captured using Lagrangian modeling. Time and length scales of the continuous carrier phase are fully simulated and by varying the properties of the modeled spray, a database of spray carrier phase direct numerical simulation (CP-DNS) is obtained. The CP-DNS is then filtered on a coarse grid to conduct a priori tests of subgrid scale (SGS) closures. The objective is to provide methods for approximating the level of SGS mixture fraction variance in large eddy simulation (LES) of fuel spray turbulent combustion. Direct estimation of the variance from the scales resolved in LES is first discussed. Then, the solving of a balance equation to get the variance is addressed, with closures for the scalar dissipation rate and the correlation between vapor source and mixture fraction.

  abstract = {The pre- and auto-ignition behavior of methane under varying levels of preheat in a turbulent flow field has been studied through the combination of detailed chemistry with a transported PDF approach closed at the joint-scalar level. The study considers the Cabra Burner configuration, which consists of a central methane/air jet issuing into a vitiated co-flow. The aim of the work is to explore the detailed thermochemical flow structure and to substantially reduce uncertainties associated with the chemical kinetics. The applied chemistry features 44 solved species and 256 reactions and includes low temperature oxygen adducts. The mechanism has, in related work, been shown to reproduce the spontaneous temperature limit for methane and ethane along with ignition delays times at higher temperatures. Radiation is accounted for through the RADCAL method and the inclusion of enthalpy into the joint-scalar PDF. Molecular mixing is closed using the modified Curl's model and a set of time-scale ratios (C$\phi$, = 2.3, 2.5, 3.0 and 4.0) have been used to explore the model sensitivity. The impact on predictions of variations in the pilot stream composition have been explored by varying concentrations of OH and H2 over a wide range. A detailed analysis of the flame structure, focusing on the chemical processes occurring before and during the ignition, suggests that the burner conditions lead to a classical auto-ignition pattern with the early formation of HO2 and CH2O prior to ignition. The work suggests that, under the current conditions, flame stabilization is dominated by turbulence-chemistry interactions rather than by specific modes of flame propagation. The work shows a significant sensitivity to the pilot stream composition and that residual H2 acts as an ignition promoter. However, the sensitivity to the time-scale ratio C $\phi$ is shown to be less than can be expected from studies of flame extinction using the same methodology. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Combustion Institute.

The spray is formed upstream of the exit plane and carried with air or nitrogen into a hot co-flowing stream of vitiated combustion products. The fluid dynamics is kept intentionally simple and the boundary conditions are well-defined such that the burner lends itself easily to computations. The stability characteristics are presented here for a range of liquid fuels as a function of the controlling parameters. For each fuel, three types of flames are identified based on their visual appearance. These flames are all lifted but differ in the shape of the leading edge and heat release zones. These characteristics are similar for all fuels and three flames, one from each type, are selected for further study. Measurements of mean temperature, velocity and droplet fields as well as high-speed LIF images of OH, Mie scattering from droplets and chemiluminescence of CH*are made in the selected flames of ethanol. It is found that the leading edge of the flame, which is a hardly visible light-blue zone close to the jet exit plane, is marked by the presence of OH (but not CH*), and slight increases in peak temperature above the levels of the co-flow. Further downstream, there exists an intense blue region that is characterized by higher OH levels, significant emission of CH*, and temperatures that are much higher than those of the co-flow. This is the region where the bulk of the heat release is taking place. Pockets of CH*are seen to appear in this region and grow as they are advected further downstream. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract = {A sparse particle implementation of the multiple mapping conditioning / large eddy simulation (MMC-LES) model is assessed against direct numerical simulations (DNS) of non-premixed syngas combustion in the double shear layer configuration of Hawkes et{\"{i}}¿½al. (2007). The considered configuration features strong extinction and reignition and therefore poses a stringent test of the model's capabilities to capture finite-rate chemistry effects. The investigation focuses on the modelling of the Lagrangian mixing time scale, $\tau$L, which emulates the dissipation of conditional subfilter scalar fluctuations. An a posteriori strategy is used to separate LES errors from potential shortcomings in modelling of $\tau$L. The DNS data are filtered on the LES grid to compute all LES-filtered quantities that are needed for the modelling of $\tau$Lwhile the (unfiltered) DNS velocity and mixture fraction fields are used for particle transport and mixing model localization, respectively. The results show that the previously derived and most commonly used model for $\tau$L(Cleary {\&} Klimenko, 2011) is capable of accurately capturing the temporal evolution of the mean quantities in the flame and that, by virtue of the controlled localisation of the generalised MMC mixing model in a reference mixture fraction space, statistical predictions are quite insensitive to variations in the spatial distance between particles. However, the model yields significant under-predictions of the conditional variances of the reactive scalars, both for the reference case and an additional case with a reduced reaction zone thickness. It is shown that for these particular flames the conditional variance under-predictions cannot be completely remedied by tuning the input parameter fmwhich determines the amount of mixing localisation in reference mixture fraction space. Instead, this shortcoming is attributed to the model for $\tau$L. Alternative model closures are suggested which are based on a consistent anisotropic or isotropic perspective on subfilter scalar mixing in sparse particle schemes. The anisotropic closure is demonstrated to significantly improve the model predictions, in particular for the conditional scalar variances. Additionally the predictions show less sensitivity to variations in fmproviding good potential for improved robustness of sparse particle methods for MMC-LES. A series of tests involving a three order of magnitude increase in particle number is conducted to demonstrate numerical convergence. During those tests the two primary model parameters, fmand rmwhich control the mixing distance between particles in both mixture fraction space and physical space, are held constant so that those mixing distances are independent of the number of particles used and, at the same time, the sparse character of the mixing model is preserved.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The high flow rate of the droplet-laden air prevents the flame front from propagating through this evaporated, but well-mixed fuel/air mixture. Comparison with experiments displayed large discrepancies concerning the droplet inflow conditions. In particular, the inflow turbulence is significantly modified by droplet-turbulence interactions in the injection pipe. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract = {a new model for atomization, focused on the description of the primary breakup, has been developed. For high injection velocities, the dense zone located just at the injector exit is generally not well described because of the strong interactions between complex phenomena. The classical Lagrangian approach that considers individual liquid droplets or blobs is not a satisfactory representation for such complex liquid flow topologies with liquid core ligaments and eventually droplets. Here, a more global approach is used, with liquid and gas considered as two species of a unique turbulent flow. Therefore, the initial liquid dispersion is given by a turbulent liquid mass flux. The purpose of this work is first to evaluate the usual models for this turbulent liquid flux and then to modify them for the spe-cific turbulent flow with a very high density ratio considered here.},

  abstract = {A series of turbulent, piloted dimethyl ether (DME)/air jet flames (Sandia DME flames D–G'), with Reynolds numbers ranging from 29,300 to 73,250, has been simulated using a sparse-Lagrangian multiple mapping conditioning (MMC) approach coupled to a large eddy simulation (LES) flow field solver. Mixing between the Monte-Carlo particles is modelled by a generalised form of MMC combined with a sparse distribution of particles leading to significant computational savings compared to what is required for conventional mixing models. This is achieved by pairwise mixing of particles that are selected dependent on their distance in an extended space comprised of a reference variable, given by the LES mixture fraction, and spatial location. The MMC-LES method successfully predicts the flame structure and composition field for the full flame series. Numerical results are compared against conditional statistics and spatially resolved experimental data acquired with Raman/Rayleigh scattering and laser-induced fluorescence measurements. They show good agreement even for flame DME-G' where large turbulence-chemistry interactions lead to significant local extinction and large deviations from a flamelet structure. The influence of the mixing time on the predicted flame structure is investigated, and the systematic validation of the time scale models with the aid of measurements of the entire flame series has corroborated the findings of earlier DNS and single flame studies: a modified time scale model is needed to provide accurate predictions of conditional fluctuations and thus of possible deviations from a flamelet-like combustion regime.},

@article{Jones2010,
  abstract = {Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is applied to turbulent kerosene and acetone sprays and the effect of turbulence and temperature fluctuations on the structure of the sprays under cold and evaporating conditions is discussed. Two different fuels were selected; kerosene which has a relatively high boiling point (480 K) at atmospheric pressure, and acetone, which has a boiling point of 329 K and thus evaporates at room temperature. In both cases liquid fuel is injected into a co-flowing air stream, which in the kerosene case is preheated at 450 K. A Lagrangian formulation is adopted for the particle dispersion coupled with an Eulerian description for the continuous phase. The Ranz-Marshall correlations are used for the Nusselt and Sherwood numbers. A stochastic model has been used for the representation of the sub-grid scale velocity fluctuations on the particle motion and temperature. The results show good agreement when compared with the experimental findings. The mean velocities of the liquid phase are found to follow the behaviour of a conventional jet flow and the profiles of the rms fluctuations are characterised by local maxima and minima, that indicate the location of the shear layers. The spreading rate is inversely related to the droplet size; as the size of the dispersed phase increases, the spreading rate is reduced. The maximum liquid flux decreases with the downstream distance, due to the evaporation of the liquid phase. Smaller particles were found to be dragged in the core jet region and droplet evaporation, was shown to be a size-selective process, enhanced for smaller particles. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Karpetis2000,
  abstract = {An experiment system was designed for the study of well-defined turbulent nonpremixed spray flames. Particular emphasis was placed on minimizing the influence of the injector design and on maximizing turbulence within the spray flames. A comprehensive description of the structure of such flames was obtained by applying a variety of complementary diagnostic techniques, including: broadband chemiluminescence imaging, CH* emission imaging, phase Doppler interferometric techniques, and spontaneous Raman spectroscopy. Two methanol spray flames were examined in detail, with Reynolds number ranging from 2.1 x 104to 2.8 x 104. Flame appearance and detailed measurements confirmed the occurrence of group combustion. Near the burner mouth, a dense column of drops enveloped by a common flame was observed. Further up, large corrugated structures were visualized which eventually developed into separate “islands.” A significant fraction of the spray escaped unburned, which implies that droplet evaporation is slow in this configuration. Detailed scanning of the flames provided an extensive database of average and fluctuating components of gas velocity and temperature, as well as spray and droplet size-classified properties. Key conclusions from such measurements include: the evidence of two-way coupling between the two phases along the centerline near the burner mouth; a velocity acceleration in the densest areas of the spray flames, as a result of momentum addition through vaporization, followed by deceleration farther downstream as the jet spreading predominates; and the droplet inertial behavior, especially for the large size classes, as confirmed by estimates of some relevant Stokes numbers. The average flame height was found to correlate with an overall equivalence ratio and with the initial concentration of droplets at the burner mouth. {\textcopyright} 2000 by The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract = {Simulations of an n-heptane spray autoigniting under conditions relevant to a diesel engine are performed using two-dimensional, first-order conditional moment closure (CMC) with full treatment of spray terms in the mixture fraction variance and CMC equations. The conditional evaporation term in the CMC equations is closed assuming interphase exchange to occur at the droplet saturation mixture fraction values only. Modeling of the unclosed terms in the mixture fraction variance equation is done accordingly. Comparison with experimental data for a range of ambient oxygen concentrations shows that the ignition delay is overpredicted. The trend of increasing ignition delay with decreasing oxygen concentration, however, is correctly captured. Good agreement is found between the computed and measured flame lift-off height for all conditions investigated. Analysis of source terms in the CMC temperature equation reveals that a convective-reactive balance sets in at the flame base, with spatial diffusion terms being important, but not as important as in lifted jet flames in cold air. Inclusion of droplet terms in the governing equations is found to affect the mixture fraction variance field in the region where evaporation is the strongest, and to slightly increase the ignition delay time due to the cooling associated with the evaporation. Both flame propagation and stabilization mechanisms, however, remain unaffected.},

The sensitivity to the number of particles used in the simulations, the mixing localization structure, chemistry and numerical time step are all investigated. The analysis shows that consistency between the FDF and LES fields is relatively insensitive to the sparseness of the particle distributions and other model parameters but that the reactive species are strongly dependent on the degree of mixing localization in the LES mixture fraction space. An algorithm is developed to control the localization for any sparse distribution of particles with inter-particle distances within the inertial range, and it is shown that reactive species predictions are sensitive to the mixing distance in a reference mixture fraction space while there is very low sensitivity to the number of particles used in the simulations. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

@phdthesis{Ukai2014,
  abstract = {The scope of this thesis is to develop an improved methodology for the simulation of turbulent spray flames. Spray combustion is a typical multi-scale problem. It is practically impossible to resolve all physical scales, and appropriate models need to be used for the subgrid scales. Here, large eddy simulation (LES) for the com- putation of the flow field, conditional moment closure (CMC) for the modelling of turbulence-chemistry interactions, and a Lagrangian particle tracking approach with stochastic droplet modelling for transport and evaporation of the droplets are combined to form a comprehensive spray combustion model. The LES flow solver and the liquid phase models have been validated by com- parison with experimental data from an evaporating spray jet. The numerical predictions show good agreement with the measurements. The influence of the stochastic particle dispersion and evaporation models is assessed. The stochastic dispersion does not have large effects on the droplet dispersion statistics probably due to low levels of turbulence in the cases investigated here. However, higher evaporation rates are seen when the stochastic evaporation model is used. In a further step, the effects of additional terms in the CMC formulation that arise due to the presence of the evaporating droplets are investigated by compa- rison with experiments from a series of turbulent ethanol spray flames. Overall, the numerical predictions show good agreement with measurements, but large discre- pancies of centerline temperature are found in downstream regions of the flow. The reasons can be found in the rather simplistic conventional boundary conditions used in this first study. The simplistic boundary treatment may suffice for simple gaseous flames or spray flames without pre-evaporation. However, it is not applicable to the spray flames under investigation here, and a new boundary treatment of the up- per limit in mixture fraction space is necessary. Therefore, two novel approaches are proposed and developed for the consistent CMC modelling of spray flames with pre-evaporation. The first model is a two-conditional moment approach. It solves for two sets of conditional moments. The first set is conditioned on a fully conserved mixture fraction that does not take droplet evaporation into account. The second set is conditioned on a mixture fraction that is based on the fuel originating from the pre- evaporated droplets plus the fuel evaporated within the combustion chamber. The LES solution can be found by using the weighted average of these two conditional moments and integration across mixture fraction space. The two-conditional mo- ment approach is applied to simulate the turbulent spray flames and the accuracy of the numerical predictions is markedly improved when compared to the conventional approach. The secondmodel is based on a CMC approach coupled with tabulated chemistry. CMC can solve for unsteady and inhomogeneous conditional moments, whereas tab- ulated chemistry is pre-processed and it is usually not a function of space or time. On the other hand, tabulated chemistry can be constructed over multiple sam- pling spaces, while CMC is typically conditioned on only one characteristic quantity. Therefore, CMC with tabulated chemistry is developed to couple the advantages of the two approaches. The numerical simulations have again been validated by compa- rison with experiments, and overall good agreement with all available experimental data are obtained. In conclusion, a new mixture fraction boundary treatment and two novel CMC approaches have been developed that expand the applicability of CMC to spray flames with partial pre-evaporation of the fuel. The new models are validated by comparison withmeasurements froma spray flame series conducted at the University of Sydney. Future work will seek the extension of the current approaches to more complex flame regimes such as partially premixed spray flames.},

  abstract = {Predicting the liquid film dynamics inside the injector cup of gas-centered swirl-coaxial fuel injectors requires a general two-phase approach that is appropriate for all liquid-volume fractions, high Mach and Weber numbers, and complex geometries. A Eulerian two-phase model is implemented to represent the liquid and gas interactions in the injector as well as the atomization processes occurring at the rough interface. Previous work using an incompressible formulation encountered difficulty in matching film profiles at large mass flow rates. The current work is an enhanced approach that includes compressibility effects. The improvement gained by implementing a compressible formulation is attributed to a sudden expansion occurring following the injector lip. Two-dimensional results are compared to high-speed photographs of the liquid film within the injector cup. Applications of closures for the turbulent liquid flux commonly used in the literature are presented and are shown to substantially overpredict the atomization rate. By limiting the rate at which entrainment occurs via the Schmidt number, the film profile is accurately predicted over a wide range of momentum flux ratios, highlighting the stabilizing effect the swirl has upon the atomization process. The applicability of this modeling approach and an assessment of the necessity for investigating Reynolds stress closures in future work are assessed.},

  abstract = {An n-dodecane spray in temperature and pressure conditions typical of diesel engines, known as Spray A, is modelled by the transported probability density function (TPDF) method coupled with a time-dependent Reynolds-averaged k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model and a Lagrangian discrete phase model of the liquid spray. To establish a baseline for comparisons, non-reacting cases are first studied. Good results are obtained for the vapour penetration, the mean and variance of fuel mixture fraction, and velocity profiles, with variations in ambient density and injection pressure. These comparisons are more extensive than previous studies due to new experimental data being available. Reacting cases are then investigated for a number of ambient conditions and injection parameters, employing a reduced chemical kinetic model. The chemical mechanism incorporates an OH* sub-mechanism (Hall and Petersen, 2006) which enables a direct comparison with experimental measurements of the lift-off length that are based on OH* chemiluminescence. To assess the importance of interactions between turbulence and chemistry, the results from the PDF model are compared to the measurements and to those from a well-mixed model that ignores turbulent fluctuations. Variations of ambient temperature, ambient oxygen concentration, ambient density, and injection pressure are considered. In all cases the PDF model with the EMST mixing model and Cϕ=1.5 shows an excellent agreement with the experimental lift-off length and presents improved results compared with the well-mixed model. Ignition delay is however over-predicted by both the PDF method and well-mixed models. Available shock tube data suggests that this may be due to the chemical kinetic model over-predicting ignition delay at higher pressures.},

@article{Bhattacharjee2013,
  abstract = {Time-dependent Reynolds-averaged CFD is performed for transient turbulent spray flames in a high-pressure, constant-volume chamber for two single-component fuels using skeletal chemical mechanisms. The simulations span a range of initial pressures, temperatures and compositions that correspond to conventional and advanced (e.g., low-temperature) compression-ignition engine combustion. The objectives are to establish the extent to which turbulent fluctuations in composition and temperature influence ignition delays and lift-off lengths and turbulent flame structure under engine-relevant conditions, and to provide insight into turbulence-chemistry interactions. This is done by comparing results from a model that accounts for turbulent fluctuations using a transported composition probability density function (PDF) method with those from a model that ignores the influence of turbulent fluctuations on local mean reaction rates (a locally well-stirred reactor - WSR - model). For robust diesel combustion conditions, the WSR and PDF computed ignition delays and lift-off lengths are close to each other, and both are in good agreement with experiment. For lower initial temperatures, ignition delays and lift-off lengths from the two models are significantly different, and the results from the PDF model are in better agreement with experiment. The differences are especially striking for n-dodecane. There the PDF-model computed ignition delays and lift-off lengths are within 10{\%} of measured values for initial temperatures of 900K and higher (for 22.8kg/m3density, 15{\%} oxygen), while the WSR model predicts an ignition delay that is three times the measured value at 900K. At an initial temperature of 800K, the WSR model fails to ignite, whereas the PDF model computed ignition delay and lift-off length are within 30{\%} of the measured values. In all cases, the WSR and PDF models produce significantly different turbulent flame structures, and the differences increase with decreasing initial temperature and oxygen level. The WSR model produces a thin laminar-like flame, while the PDF model gives a broadened turbulent flame brush that is qualitatively more consistent with what is expected for these highly turbulent flames and what is observed experimentally. Thus, while it may be possible to reproduce some global ignition characteristics using a WSR model (depending on the choice of chemical mechanism), turbulent fluctuations play an increasingly important role at lower initial temperatures and oxygen levels. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations are performed on the flow of fine, polydisperse droplets of acetone ejected from a round jet of air into an ambient turbulent, uniform co-flowing air stream. The objective is to validate the numerical model by comparing the predictions with experimental measurements of a well defined evaporating spray configuration (Chen et al., Int. J. Multiphase Flow 32(2006), 389-412). The carrier-phase is considered in the Eulerian context, while the dispersed phase is tracked in the Lagrangian framework. Various interactions between the two phases are taken into account by means of a two-way coupling. The stochastic separated flow (SSF) model is adopted for the spray calculations. The gas-phase turbulence terms are closed using the standard k-epsilon model. The spray evaporation is described using a thermal model with an infinite-conductivity. Overall, very good agreement is observed in the comparisons of the computational predictions and experimental measurements. The predicted droplet number-mean axial velocity, r.m.s. of fluctuating velocity for the various droplet classes at different downstream locations exhibit a self-similarity downstream of the nozzle exit. Near the nozzle-exit (around z/d(jet) = 5), the r.m.s. of droplet number mean axial fluctuating velocity attains a maximum within the shear layer near r/d(jet) = 0.4-0.6 for different droplet classes. Further downstream, the peak shifts towards the axis. A similar variation is noticed in the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) distribution of the droplets. It is concluded that, a higher level of turbulence leads to a faster depletion of the smaller droplets, resulting in an increase in the local droplet-SMD in those regions.},

Since the PDF equation is high dimensional, a Lagrangian method formulated in cylindrical coordinates is coupled to the Eulerian solution technique for the LES flow equations. The LES/PDF simulations show that soot formation is highly intermittent and is always restricted to the fuel-rich region of the flow. The PDF of soot moments has a wide spread leading to a large subfilter variance. Further, the conditional statistics of soot moments conditioned on mixture fraction and reaction progress variable show strong correlation between the gas phase composition and soot moments. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Combustion Institute.},

In this regards, the predictive capability of combustion Large Eddy Simulation approach coupled to Lagrangian droplet dynamic model to retrieve the turbulent droplet dispersion, droplet size distribution, spray evolution and combustion properties is investigated in this paper for an ethanol spray flame. Following the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach with a fully two way coupling, the Favre-filtered low Mach number Navier-Stokes equations are solved on structured grids with dynamic sub-grid scale models to describe the turbulent carrier gas phase. Droplets are injected in polydisperse manner and generated in time dependent boundary conditions. They evaporate to form an air-fuel mixture that yields spray flame. Part of the ethanol droplets evaporates within the prevaporization area before reaching the combustion zone, making the flame to burn in a partially premixed regime. The chemistry is described by a tabulated detailed chemistry based on the flamelet generated manifold approach. The fuel, ethanol, is modeled by a detailed reaction mechanism consisting of 56 species and 351 reversible reactions. The simulation results including excess gas temperature, droplet velocities and corresponding fluctuations, droplet mean diameters and spray volume flux at different distances from the exit plane show good agreement with experimental data. Analysis of combustion spray features allows gaining a deep insight into the two-phase flow process ongoing.},

The spray is injected through an industrial pressure swirl atomiser using liquid ethanol as fuel. {\{}MILD{\}} combustion consists in burning the fuel in a high temperature environment so that the temperature gradients are limited and the production of pollutants such as {\{}NOx{\}} reduced. {\{}MILD{\}} combustion has been investigated for furnace applications and for various gaseous fuels, recently it has also been explored for spray combustion. The simulation is performed in the context of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and the transported pdf equation for the scalars is solved using the stochastic fields approach. The validation of the results is based on the comparison with experimental data. The characteristics of the injector are obtained a posteriori by the use of the measurements at downstream location. The simulation correctly reproduces the velocity profiles of the particles within their size classes and the integral particle size distribution which is represented by the Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD). The gas phase temperature and velocity are also in good agreement with the measurements, however, some discrepancies are observed, presumably because of the lack of modelling of primary atomisation. The model employed appears to reliably reproduce the behaviour of the spray combustion system under {\{}MILD{\}} conditions.},

@article{Han2016a,
  abstract = {The stabilization of lifted flames involves a complex competition between small-scale mixing and propagation of flame kernels at the base of the flame. Here, the effect of species diffusivity on this stabilization process is explored. For this purpose, a large-eddy simulation (LES)/probability density function (PDF) methodology accounting for differential diffusion is developed. A dynamic model for scalar mixing time-scale is formulated to accurately describe the turbulence-driven mixing of scalars at the small-scales. Autoignition-stabilized H2/N2 lifted turbulent flames in a vitiated coflow burner are chosen as test cases. Detailed chemical kinetics is used along with in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT) to accelerate the computations. Four configuration test cases are considered: neglecting differential diffusion (Cases 1 and 2), considering differential diffusion (Case 3) and considering differential diffusion but neglecting molecular transport of H and H2 (Case 4). A dynamic model for scalar mixing time-scale appearing in the mixing model is used in Cases 2, 3 and 4, which removes the need to specify the value of model constant. It is found that the lifted flames are very sensitive to differential diffusion. The predictions of major species mass fractions, temperatures and lift-off heights are in good agreement with the experimental data. Further, such agreement could be achieved without changing any boundary conditions. In particular, increased diffusion of species upstream allows ignition kernels to survive turbulent dissipation, causing stabilization to occur upstream. H2 and H are identified as two critical species that play a dominant role in the differential diffusion effect. The model is also able to capture the change in lift-off height with change in coflow temperature. The results show that even in turbulent flames, stabilization of the flame zone can be sensitive to molecular diffusion. In LES computations where a significant part of this diffusion effect is resolved, the use of the enhanced LES/PDF/ISAT approach is seen as a promising approach for capturing the lift-off physics accurately.},

  abstract = {Flame stabilization and the mechanisms that govern the dynamics at the flame base of lifted flames have been subject to numerous studies in recent years. A combined Large Eddy Simulation-Conditional Moment Closure (LES-CMC) approach has been successful in predicting flame ignition and stabilization by auto-ignition, but accurate modelling of the competition between turbulent quenching and laminar and turbulent flame propagation at the anchor point had not been demonstrated. This paper will consolidate LES-CMC results by analysing a wide range of lifted flame geometries with different prevailing stabilization mechanisms. The simulations allow a clear distinction of these mechanisms. It is corroborated that LES-CMC accurately predicts the competition between turbulence and chemistry during the auto-ignition process, the dynamics of turbulent flame propagation can be captured, however, the dynamics of the extinction process are not approximated well under certain conditions. The averaging process inherent in the CMC methods does not allow for an instant response of the transported conditionally averaged reactive species to the changes in the flow conditions and any response of the scalars will therefore be delayed. The dimensionality of the CMC implementation affects the solution and higher dimensionality does no necessarily improve results. Stationary or quasi-stationary conditions, however, can be well predicted for all flame configurations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

@article{Ma2016a,
  abstract = {This work studies the influence of coflow conditions on the structure of the Delft Spray in Hot-diluted Coflow (DSHC) flames, using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques. The developed modeling approach was first applied to three different experimental cases for validation. Major properties such as droplet velocity, SMD, gas phase velocity and temperature can be reproduced with good accuracy. Also, the trends of flame lift-off height and flame width with change of coflow conditions were properly captured. Then the study was extended to four more virtual cases, which differ from each other only by coflow temperature or oxygen concentration. The purpose of this step is to eliminate the simultaneous change of multiple parameters as was done in the experiment and to isolate the influences of coflow temperature and O2concentration, which are important parameters for a MILD furnace design and operation. Two reaction regions (RRs) have been identified in the DSHC flame. The inner RR is created by the premixed reaction of ethanol under hot and fuel rich condition. The outer one is formed by the non-premixed reaction of intermediate fuels, e.g. CO and H2, which are produced in the inner RR. The coflow temperature (Tcf) has a significant influence on the DSHC flames. Increase of flame lift-off height by a factor of five was observed when the coflow temperature was decreased from 1400 K to 1200 K. The flame changed from having a two-RRs structure to a triple flame when the coflow temperature is reduced. The outer RR shifted from non-premixed combustion at high Tcfto premixed combustion at low Tcf. The oxygen mole fraction in the coflow (XO2,cf) alters the role of two RRs. The inner premixed RR is strengthened with increasing XO2,cf. The flame peak temperature is significantly increased in the case with highest XO2,cf. According to Cavaliere and de Joannon's definition [1], all studied cases except the one that has the highest XO2,cf, falls into the MILD regime. But when a restriction of flame peak temperature (Tpeak{\textless} 1800 K) is also applied, only the case with the lowest XO2,cfand moderate Tcfcan be strictly called MILD.},

  abstract = {This work evaluates the performance of the $\sigma$-Y Eulerian atomization model at reproducing the internal structure of a diesel spray in the near-field. In the study, three different computational domains have been used in order to perform 3D and 2D coupled simulations, where the internal nozzle flow and external spray are modeled in one continuous domain, and 2D decoupled simulations, where only the external spray is modeled. While the 3D simulation did the best job of capturing the dense zone of the spray, the 2D simulations also performed well, with the coupled 2D simulation slightly outperforming the decoupled simulation. The similarity in results between the coupled and the decoupled simulation show that internal and external flow calculations can be performed independently. In addition, the use of spatially averaged nozzle outlet conditions, in the case of an axisymmetric (single-hole) convergent nozzle, leads to a slightly worse near-field spray predictions but to an accurate far-field ones. Finally, a novel constraint on turbulent driven mixing multiphase flows is introduced which prevents the slip velocity from exceeding the magnitude of the turbulent fluctuations through a realizable Schmidt number. This constraint increased model stability, allowing for a 4x increase in Courant number.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive mapping of the flow and droplet fields in turbulent non-reacting as well as reacting dilute spray jets of acetone and ethanol fuels. The burner is well-designed such that the boundary conditions are characterized with sufficient details and the stability limits of the flames are known. The flow is intentionally simple so that attention is shifted to the study of flow-droplet interactions with and without heat release. Velocity, turbulence and droplet size data are measured using a conventional LDV/PDA system and measurements are reported at a number of axial locations in the flow. Sequences of conditions are investigated to resolve the effects of increasing the droplet loading (at a fixed carrier flow rate, where the carrier is air) and the effects of increasing the carrier velocity (at a fixed liquid flow rate).It is shown that the decay in the mean axial excess velocity on the centerline of acetone and ethanol flames is significantly slower than in non-reacting spray jets. The centerline rms velocity fluctuations in non-reacting jets peak around x/. D= 10 while in the acetone and ethanol flames the peak occurs further downstream at around 80{\%} of the length of the flame. In both reacting and non-reacting jets, large droplets exit the nozzle with negative slip velocities and a changeover occurs further downstream where the slip velocity of large droplets becomes positive. Radial dispersion of droplets decreases with increasing Stokes number while the axial rms fluctuations may remain high due to  memory effects as well as to droplet shedding from the inner wall of the fuel pipe hence leading to high anisotropy. The extensive data base, noting similarities and differences between the non-reacting and reacting jets, will facilitate model development and validation for dilute sprays. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Combustion Institute.},

@article{James2002,
  abstract = {Probability density function (PDF) transport methods are increasingly used in simulations of gas turbine combustors. One of the main advantages of the PDF transport method is that the crucial turbulence-chemistry interaction is accurately accounted for. Due to its large dimensionality, the PDF transport equation is solved using one of two Monte-Carlo methods - the Eulerian (or node-based) method and the Lagrangian method. Studies on the Eulerian method show that a large number of particles per cell is necessary for accurate simulations. In the present study, the Lagrangian method is developed for the simulation of actual gas turbine combustors. The key technologies developed are a robust particle tracking algorithm and a variable time-step algorithm to accelerate the convergence of the flow. The accuracy of the Lagrangian method is evaluated by applying it to several combustor configurations. A model combustor and two production combustors are studied. The predicted exit temperature profiles are in excellent agreement with rig data. Simulations show that even with 10 particles per cell, accurate results are obtained. The study shows that the Lagrangian Monte-Carlo PDF method can be reliably used in simulations of practical gas turbine combustors. {\textcopyright} 2002 by Rolls-Royce Corporation and Cornell University.},

The new model includes the effects of variable thermophysical properties, non-unitary Lewis number in the gas film, the effect of the Stefan flow on heat and mass transfer between the droplet and the gas, and the effect of internal circulation and transient liquid heating. To evaluate the competing simplified models of the droplet heating, the more-refined, extended model of heat transfer within a moving circulating droplet is considered. A simplified, one-dimensional ‘effective conductivity' model is formulated for the transient liquid heating with internal circulation. As an illustration, the dynamic and vaporization histories of the droplets injected into the steady and fluctuating hot air streams are analyzed.

  abstract = {A systematic assessment of the submodels of conditional moment closure (CMC) formalism for the autoignition problem is carried out using direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. An initially non-premixed, n-heptane/air system, subjected to a three-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic and decaying turbulence, is considered. Two kinetic schemes, (1) a one-step and (2) a reduced four-step reaction mechanism, are considered for chemistry. An alternative formulation is developed for closure of the mean chemical source term (w/$\nu$), based on the condition that the instantaneous fluctuation of excess, temperature is small. With this model, it is shown that the CMC equations describe the autoignition process all the way up to near the equilibrium limit. The effect of second-order terms (namely, conditional variance of temperature excess $\delta$2 and conditional correlations of species qij) in modeling (w/$\eta$) is examined. Comparison with DNS data shows that $\delta$2 has little effect on the predicted conditional mean temperature evolution, if the average conditional scalar dissipation rate (N/$\eta$) is properly modeled. Using DNS data, a correction factor is introduced in the modeling of nonlinear terms (YiYj/$\eta$) to include the effect of species fluctuations. Computations including such a correction factor show that the species conditional correlations qij have little effect on model predictions with a one-step reaction, but those qij involving in termediate species are found to be crucial when four-step reduced kinetics is considered. The “most reactive mixture fraction” is found to vary with time when a four-step kinetics is considered. First-order CMC results are found to be qualitatively wrong if the conditional mean scalar dissipation rate is not modeled properly. The autoignition delay time predicted by the CMC model compares excellently with DNS results and shows a trend similar to experimental data over a range of initial temperatures.},

  abstract = {Confined short turbulent swirling premixed and non-premixed methane and heptane spray flames stabilized on an axisymmetric bluff body in a square enclosure have been examined close to the blow-off limit and during the extinction transient with OHchemiluminescence and OH-PLIF operated at 5 kHz. The comparison of flames of different canonical types in the same basic aerodynamic field allows insights on the relative blow-off behaviour. The flame structure has been examined for conditions increasingly closer to blow-off. The premixed flame was seen to change from a cylindrical shape at stable burning condtions, with the flame brush closing across the flow at conditions close to blow-off. The PLIF images show that for the gaseous non-premixed flame, holes appear along the flame sheet with increasing frequency as the blow-off condition is approached, while the trend is less obvious for the spray flame. Non-premixed and spray flames showed randomly-occurring lift-off, which is further evidence of localised extinction. The mean lift-off height increased with increasing fuel jet velocity and decreased with increasing air velocity and approaches zero (i.e. the flame is virtually attached) just before the blow-off condition, despite the fact that more holes were evident in the flame sheet as extinction was approached. It was found that the average duration of the blow-off event, when normalised with the characteristic flow time d/U b (d being the bluff-body diameter and U b the bulk velocity) was in the range 9-38 with the spray flame extinction lasting a shorter time than the gaseous flames. Finally, it was found that correlations based on a Damk{\"{o}}hler number collapse the blow-off velocity data for all flames with reasonable accuracy. The results can help the development of advanced turbulent combustion models. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  abstract = {Brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) changes during intraoperative monitoring may reflect damage to or potentially reversible dysfunction of the ear, the eighth nerve, or the brainstem auditory pathways up to the level of the mesencephalon. They may also be caused by other physiologic mechanisms such as anesthesia, hypothermia, and acoustic masking from drilling noise, or they may result from technical factors that prevent proper stimulus delivery or recording of an evoked potential that is actually present. Cochlear ischemia or infarction resulting from compromise of the internal auditory artery and inner ear damage during temporal bone drilling will affect all BAEP components, including wave I. Direct mechanical or thermal trauma to the eighth nerve will delay, attenuate, and possibly eliminate waves III and V, but wave I, which is generated at the cochlear end of the eighth nerve, may be preserved. During scraping of tumor off the eighth nerve, force applied in an ear-toward-brainstem direction can avulse the fragile fibers of the distal eighth nerve at the area cribrosa. Prolonging the I-to-III interpeak interval during retraction of the cerebellum and brainstem reflects stretching of the eighth nerve, and is often reversible. Vasospasm within the eighth nerve can cause similar, potentially reversible BAEP changes. Damage to the brainstem auditory pathways at or below the level of the mesencephalon will delay and attenuate or eliminate wave V. Wave III is affected similarly if the damage is at or caudal to the region of the superior olivary complex. These BAEP changes may reflect direct mechanical or thermal damage to the brainstem, brainstem compression, or ischemia or infarction resulting from vascular compromise. During BAEP monitoring, examination of the pattern of BAEP changes, analysis of their correlation with surgical maneuvers, and investigation for possible contributory technical factors can help to determine the cause of the BAEP changes and provide the appropriate information to the rest of the surgical team.},

  abstract = {A hybrid large-eddy simulation/filtered-density function (LES-FDF) methodology is formulated for simulating variable density turbulent reactive flows. An indirect feedback mechanism coupled with a consistency measure based on redundant density fields contained in the different solvers is used to construct a robust algorithm. Using this novel scheme, a partially premixed methane/air flame is simulated. To describe transport in composition space, a 16-species reduced chemistry mechanism is used along with the interaction-by-exchange with the mean (IEM) model. For the micro-mixing model, typically a constant ratio of scalar to mechanical time-scale is assumed. This parameter can have substantial variations and can strongly influence the combustion process. Here, a dynamic time-scale model is used to prescribe the mixing time-scale, which eliminates the time-scale ratio as a model constant. Two different flame configurations, namely, Sandia flames D and E are studied. Comparison of simulated radial profiles with experimental data show good agreement for both flames. The LES-FDF simulations accurately predict the increased extinction near the inlet and re-ignition further downstream. The conditional mean profiles show good agreement with experimental data for both flames.},

  abstract = {Local heat release rate represents one of the most interesting experimental observables in the study of unsteady reacting flows. The direct measure of burning or heat release rate as a field variable is not possible. Numerous experimental investigations have relied on inferring this type of information as well as flame-front topology from indirect measures that are presumed to be correlated. A recent study has brought into question many of the commonly used flame-front marker and burning-rate diagnostics. This same study found that the concentration of formyl radical offers the best possibility for measuring flame burning rate. However, primarily due to low concentrations, the fluorescence signal level from formyl is too weak to employ this diagnostic for single-pulse measurements of turbulent-reacting flows. In this paper, we describe and demonstrate a new fluorescence-based reaction-front imaging diagnostic suitable for single-shot applications. The measurement is based on taking the pixel-by-pixel product of OH and CH2O planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) images to yield an image closely related to a reaction rate. The spectroscopic and collisional processes affecting the measured signals are discussed, and the foundation of the diagnostic, as based on laminar and unsteady flame calculations, is presented. We report the results of applying this diagnostic to the study of a laminar premixed flame subject to an interaction with an isolated line-vortex pair.},

The model considers a single phase of liquid-gas mixture to represent the turbulent mixing of the liquid sheet with the ambient gas. As the flow is highly swirled and highly anisotropic, the Reynolds stress model is used for turbulence. The turbulent flux of liquid mass fraction is modeled taking into account density variation effect. The mean liquid-gas interface density balance equation is solved to get the Sauter Mean Diameter of droplets. 2-D axisymmetric swirl calculations have been performed using 3-D results as boundary conditions in order to reduce the computational time. Experimental data are obtained using Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). Atomization characteristics such as the axial velocity and droplet Sauter Mean Diameter were determined experimentally and were compared with the modeling results. Agreement between predictions and measurements is reasonably good. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Marchione2009,
  abstract = {This paper examines ignition processes of an n-heptane spray in a flow typical of a liquid-fuelled burner. The spray is created by a hollow-cone pressure atomiser placed in the centre of a bluff body, around which swirling air induces a strong recirculation zone. Ignition was achieved by single small sparks of short duration (2 mm; 0.5 ms), located at various places inside the flow so as to identify the most ignitable regions, or larger sparks of longer duration (5 mm; 8 ms) repeated at 100 Hz, located close to the combustion chamber enclosure so as to mimic the placement and characteristics of a gas turbine combustor surface igniter. The air and droplet velocities, the droplet diameter, and the total (i.e. liquid plus vapour) equivalence ratio were measured in inert flow by phase Doppler anemometry and sampling respectively. Fast camera imaging suggested that successful ignition events were associated with flamelets that propagated back towards the spray nozzle. Measurements of ignition probability with the single spark showed that localised ignition inside the spray is more likely to result in successful flame establishment when the spark is located in a region of negative velocity, relatively small droplet Sauter mean diameter, and mean equivalence ratio within the flammability limits. Ignition with the single spark was not possible at the location where the multiple spark experiments were performed. For those, the multiple spark sequence lasted approximately 1 to 5 s. It was found that a long spark sequence increases the ignition efficiency, which reached a maximum of 100{\%} at the axial distance where the recirculation zone had maximum width. Ignition was not feasible with the spark downstream of about two burner diameters. Visualisation showed that small flame kernels emanate very often from the spark, which can be stretched as far as 20 mm from the electrodes by the turbulent velocity fluctuations. These kernels survive very little time. Successful overall ignition occurs at a random time from the spark initiation and, as in the case of the single spark, success is associated with kernels that move without getting extinguished towards the bluff body. The results demonstrate that the energy deposited by multiple sparks and spark stretching in a turbulent flow can have a spatially far-reaching effect to initiate combustion. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract = {The initiation of turbulent non-premixed combustion of gaseous fuels through autoignition and through spark ignition is reviewed, motivated by the increasing relevance of these phenomena for new combustion technologies. The fundamentals of the associated turbulent-chemistry interactions are emphasized. Background information from corresponding laminar flow problems, relevant turbulent combustion modelling approaches, and the ignition of turbulent sprays are included. For both autoignition and spark ignition, examination of the reaction zones in mixture fraction space is revealing. We review experimental and numerical data on the stochastic nature of the emergence of autoignition kernels and of the creation of kernels and subsequent flame establishment following spark ignition, aiming to reveal the particular facet of the turbulence causing the stochasticity. In contrast to fully-fledged turbulent combustion where the effects of turbulence on the reaction are reasonably well-established, at least qualitatively, here the turbulence can cause trends that are not straightforward. Autoignition occurs usually away from stoichiometry at a most reactive mixture fraction, which can be approximately determined from homogeneous or laminar flow autoignition calculations, and at locations in the turbulent flow with low scalar dissipation. Such locations may be the cores of vortices. Once autoignition has occurred at a time that is mostly affected by the history of the conditional scalar dissipation, the relative magnitudes of convection, diffusion and reaction can affect the stabilisation height of flames in sprays or jets. Modelling efforts based on the Conditional Moment Closure, advanced flamelet approaches, and the transported PDF method seem suitable for capturing many, but not yet all, of the trends observed in DNS or experiment. Further experiments and DNS of realistic fuels and at conditions demonstrating chemical complexities must be performed to examine more fully the effects of scalar dissipation and its fluctuations on pre-ignition reaction zones. The statistics of the first appearance of autoignition in transient problems and its connection with the mixing field must also be studied. Ignition from a localised spark has a stochastic character that depends on the mixture fraction sampled at the spark location and duration and the local scalar dissipation. The success or not of the subsequent flame depends on the development of turbulent edge or stratified flames. Only preliminary data exist on the propagation speed of such flames and on their quenching. A lot remains to be done on turbulent edge flame propagation in unreacted and partially-reacted mixtures with inhomogeneities, turbulent flame propagation in non-uniformly dispersed droplet mists, and the transient stabilisation process of recirculating flames. The nature of the flame generation process at very short timescales, i.e. before any appreciable propagation, by sparking in inhomogeneous mixtures needs also to be examined. The development of high repetition rate diagnostics, for single- and two-phase flows, and the development of modelling approaches capturing both premixed and non-premixed reaction zones in gaseous and spray combustion are necessary. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Excellent results are obtained in the computation of plane-averaged properties, such as product mass fractions and relatively high powers of the temperature, and even of the p.d.f. of the conserved scalar itself. In all these cases the errors are small enough to be useful in practical applications. The analysis is extended to slightly out-of-equilibrium problems, such as the generation of radicals, and formulated in terms of the p.d.f. of the gradient of the mixture fraction. It is shown that the form of the conditional gradient distribution is universal in a wide range of cases, whose limits are established. Within those limits, engineering approximations to the radical concentration are also possible. It is argued that the experiments in this paper are already in the limit of high Reynolds numbers.},

@article{Salehi2017,
  abstract = {This paper presents a probability density function (PDF) form of the population balance equation (PBE) for polysized and polyshaped droplets and solid particles in turbulent flows. A key contribution of this paper lies in the inclusion of an explicit consideration of the inertial effects and the shape of particles in the PDF-PBE formulation. The number density is taken as a function of droplet or particle size (volume) and shape as well as space and time. Potentially, other particle properties could also be included in the formulation. Inertial effects are quantified through the Stokes number, leading to accurate modelling of the different trajectories that are followed by droplets and/or particles with different sizes and shapes. To treat these effects, a new affordable approach is proposed and referred to as the method of Stokes binning. Here, the inertial dispersed elements are accelerated due to fluid dynamic forces associated with an averaged Stokes number in each bin. The model is validated against two data sets. The first data set includes a series of numerical test cases involving the injection of polyshaped droplets ranging in size from 1 to 50 {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x03BC{\}}\backslashtext{\{}m{\}}{\$} into a turbulent jet resulting in inlet Stokes numbers ranging from 0.03 to 75.2. The second data set consists of an experimental case focusing on the dispersion of 60 and 90 {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x03BC{\}}\backslashtext{\{}m{\}}{\$} spherical droplets in a turbulent round jet, resulting in inlet Stokes numbers of 53 and 122, respectively. The results confirm the ability of the approach to accurately model the polysized and polyshaped droplet dispersion using as few as eight Stokes bins. This approach has the potential to greatly reduce the computational cost of modelling the evolution of inertial droplets and particles in turbulent flows.},

A new piloted burner is introduced for this purpose featuring air-blast atomization, with liquid injection from a needle that can be translated within a co-flowing air stream. The stability characteristics are presented for three recess lengths using acetone as fuel. High-speed shadowgraph imaging is performed in the atomization region of jets and flames having different liquid loading and recess distances. Three types of fluid fragments are used to map the evolution of these sprays: droplets, ligaments and ‘irregular' shapes. Statistics for each class of these fluid shapes are presented to map the boundary conditions at the jet exit plane and to track their evolution with downstream distance along the jet. These show clearly how ligaments and irregular shapes break down to supply more droplets further downstream. Measurements of liquid surface area show a peak in the mean area and its rms of fluctuations around two jet diameters from the point of injection marking the region of maximum atomization. It is also evident that the process of primary and secondary atomization is completed by about seven jet diameters from the liquid injection point. This burner provides a versatile platform for studying these flows and the resulting information is already proving to be extremely useful in the development and validation of related models for turbulent spray jets and flames.},

As discussed in previous reports (Mahesh et al. 2000, 2001) the gas phase solver is non-dissipative and discretely conserves energy, thus insuring both accuracy and robustness for high Reynolds number simulations in complex geometries. A dynamic procedure is used to compute the coefficients in the additional terms that are present in the filtered momentum and scalar-transport equations.

@article{Tsang2018,
  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, IMechE 2018. A sub-grid model accounting for the interaction of spray and sub-grid turbulence was developed and tested. The model predicts the sub-grid scale dispersion velocity used for calculating the slip velocity in Lagrangian–Eulerian Large-eddy simulation spray models. The dispersion velocity is assumed to be decomposed into a deterministic and a stochastic part, and it is updated in every turbulence correlation time for each computational parcel. The model was validated against two datasets: volume-of-fluid simulations and Engine Combustion Network experiments. The volume-of-fluid data showed that dispersion velocities at the centerline are anisotropic. This qualitative feature is well captured by the current model. For the Engine Combustion Network Spray A cases, it was found that sub-grid scale dispersion has profound impact on the prediction of the spatial distribution of liquid mass. Neglecting the sub-grid scale dispersion model results in underprediction of the width of the lateral projected liquid mass density profiles. Also, the prediction of the projected liquid mass density is sensitive to the two model constants determining the sub-grid scale dispersion velocity magnitude and turbulence time scale. However, the predictions of resolved gas-phase statistics are relatively insensitive to different sub-grid scale dispersion model setups. The primary reason for this was investigated. It was found that the motion of high-momentum liquid blobs in the near-nozzle region leading to air entrainment and subsequent gas jet development is minimally influenced by sub-grid scale dispersion. The importance of sub-grid scale dispersion inversely correlates with drag force magnitude: the larger the drag force, the less critical the sub-grid scale dispersion. Moving further downstream, quasi-equilibrium between the two phases is established, resulting in relatively small slip velocity and drag force.},

  abstract = {We depict and analyse the successive steps of atomization of a liquid jet when a fast gas stream blows parallel to its surface. Experiments performed with various liquids in a fast air flow show that the liquid destabilization proceeds from a two-stage mechanism: a shear instability first forms waves on the liquid. The transient acceleration experienced by the liquid suggests that a Rayleigh-Taylor type of instability is triggered at the wave crests, producing liquid ligaments which further stretch in the air stream and break into droplets. The primary wavelength $\lambda$ ∼ $\delta$($\rho$1/$\rho$2)1/2 is set by the vorticity thickness $\delta$, in the fast air stream and the liquid/gas density ratio $\rho$1/$\rho$2. The transverse corrugations of the crests have a size $\lambda$⊥ ∼ $\delta$ Wed-1/3 ($\rho$1/$\rho$2)1/3, where We$\delta$ = $\rho$2u2 2$\delta$/$\sigma$ is the Weber number constructed on the gas velocity u2 and liquid surface tension $\sigma$. The ligament dynamics gives rise, after break-up, to a well-defined droplet size distribution whose mean is given by $\lambda$⊥. This distribution bears an exponential tail characteristic of the broad size statistics in airblast sprays.},

  abstract = {The injection of liquid fuel is a common procedure in turbulent combustion devices operating in the nonpremixed regime. Various numerical models may be found in the literature to calculate such turbulent flames, using either Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes techniques (RANS) or large eddy simulation (LES). The typical inputs of nonpremixed turbulent combustion modeling are the mean and the fluctuations of the mixture fraction. In computational fluid dynamics codes, the mean source of mixture fraction may be provided by Euler-Lagrange spray modeling. However, the sources of fluctuations of mixture fraction due to vaporization require more closures. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) provides a way of estimating these sources and, using DNS of droplets evaporating in a turbulent flow, it is described how they play an important role in the time evolution of fuel/air mixing in a dilute spray. The statistical properties of the spray and of the scalar field are analyzed to propose a single droplet model (SDM) to evaluate these sources. SDM calculates mean values of the Eulerian source of fuel conditioned on the mixture fraction. (C) 2000 by The Combustion Institute.},

Ignition delay and the total pressure increase due to combustion are highly repeatable whereas the ignition location shows substantial fluctuations. Simulations have subsequently been performed by means of a first-order fully elliptic Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) code. Overall, the simulations are in good agreement with the experiment in terms of spray evolution, ignition delay and the pressure development. The sensitivity of the predictions with respect to the measured initial conditions, the spray modelling options as well as the chemical mechanism employed have been analysed. Strong sensitivity on the chemical mechanism and to the initial temperature on the predicted ignition delay is reported.

@article{Blokkeel2002a,
  abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of the atomization modeling. In order to take into account the very initial phenomena occurring at the start of this process, the so-called primary break-up, an Eulerian one flow model is used instead of the usual Lagrangian particle models more appropriate for the secondary break-up. In the initial part of the spray the liquid flow is not a set of droplets, and both interactions between liquid-liquid particles and gas-liquid particles are very strong. Due to the high initial velocity difference, between the liquid and the gas flow, the initial mixture flow can be considered as a turbulent flow. Therefore this is the turbulence model that drives the initial dispersion of the liquid. The main point of the work presented here will be a study of what will be an appropriate turbulent model for representing this phenomenon. In order to complete the modeling of the atomization, the whole model includes an equation for the liquid surface density which permits to know a characteristic size of the liquid droplets formed in the end. At the point where the spray is diluted enough, a transition to the Lagrangian particles formulation is initiated in order to benefit of the advantages of this approach in the latest stages of the atomization.},

@phdthesis{Beishuizen2007b,
  abstract = {Turbulent spray flames can be found in many applications, such as Diesel engines, rocket engines and power plants. The many practical applications are a motivation to investigate the physical phenomena occurring in turbulent spray flames in detail in order to be able to understand, predict and optimise them. Turbulent spray flames are a two-phase flow system consisting of a turbulent reacting continuum phase and a dispersed liquid phase contained in the continuum phase. In this thesis the interaction between these two phases is being studied, and specifically the effects of vaporisation and the effects of the presence of droplets on the turbulence characteristics of the continuum phase (the two-way coupling effect). The main goal of the research described in this thesis is to develop and evaluate stochastic Lagrangian models for turbulent spray flames that are characterised by significant or dominant two-way coupling effects. In the first part of the thesis, isolated droplet vaporisation models are studied and several models are evaluated. The problem of droplet interaction is briefly explained using some simple simulations and general theoretical ideas and the concept of group combustion is introduced. In the second part of the thesis the hybrid Lagrangian-Lagrangian method is presented. The continuum phase is described by the transport equation for the joint mass density function (MDF) of velocity and composition, which is solved indirectly using a Monte Carlo particle method where Langevin type equations are solved. This method is augmented by a finite volume method where the mean Eulerian transport equations for momentum, Reynolds stresses and turbulence dissipation are solved, making it a hybrid approach for the continuum phase. The dispersed phase is described solely by the dropletMDF which is also solved using a Monte Carlo method. A novel modification of the turbulence model for the pressure rate of strain in the Eulerian transport equation for the Reynolds stresses is presented that takes into account the effect of the presence of particles and the effect of mass transfer. The models in the Langevin equation in the Lagrangian formulation are then modified in order to be consistent with the pressure rate of strain model in the Eulerian formulation. The modification of the diffusion term in the Langevin equation implies a modification of Kolmogorov's hypothesis regarding the first order Lagrangian structure function. An investigation of the transport equation for the scalar dissipation rate shows that Lagrangian mixing models are affected by liquid particle vaporisation. Other theoretical developments are the extension of the Generalised Gradient diffusion model and the Daly Harlow model for the triple correlations and an exact expression for the effect of mass transfer on the turbulence dissipation. In the third part of this thesis the results of numerical simulations of two test cases are presented. In the first test case an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach was used and the influence of the modification of the model for the pressure rate of strain by the presence of particles is investigated for an axially symmetric nonburning turbulent dispersed spray and compared with experimental data. Small improvements in turbulence quantities over the conventional turbulence and twoway coupling model are noticed when the novel modification of the pressure rate of strain is being used. In the second test case, simulations of an axially symmetric turbulent spray flame are performed to illustrate the performance of the complete hybrid method proposed in this thesis. A good agreement with experimental data was found using the hybrid method. In the mass transfer controlled spray flame studied in this thesis, taking into account the reduction of the drag coefficient and the heat and mass transfer coefficient due to mass transfer turned out to be crucial to the performance of the method.},

@article{Chesnel2011a,
  abstract = {In the past decade, numerical methods for two-phase flows, which are now capable of fully describing both phases and the interface, have progressed to a state of maturity. At present, direct numerical simulations (DNS) are possible even for complex configurations such as atomization processes. However, the numerical resources necessary to completely compute the atomization up to the formation of the final spray are still out of reach. Therefore, the large eddy simulation (LES) approach is very appealing for two-phase flows. Depend-ing on the assumption concerning the relative size of the LES filter compared to the characteristic scale of interface wrinkles, two classes of LES methods have emerged: the first class of LES method is required close to the injector while the second class is needed far from the injector when the spray is formed. The present work describes a modeling proposal that solves this problem by focusing on the transition between these two classes of method for LES of two-phase flows. A postulated transport equation of the surface density is used to describe the subgrid spray formation ranging from interface wrinkling, ligaments, and sheets up to the droplets. Issued from Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) formalisms, this transport equation extends the usual spherical geometry given to the liquid structures that compose the subgrid spray. This equation contains several source terms that act on the creation and destruction of the liquid/gas interface. Considering that major breakup processes are due to turbulence in the field near the injector, an appropri-ate source term is proposed. This source term, also derived from RANS models, introduces a local critical value of surface density related to a critical Weber number that provides information concerning the local equilibrium between turbulent kinetic energy and surface energy. Concerning the velocity field, a standard Smagorinsky approach is considered. The initial results, obtained through the simulation of the atomization of a liquid jet, confirm that the subgrid term of the liquid volume fraction transport equation determines the transition between the resolved interface and the subgrid spray. An LES model for continuous two-phase flows, termed CLES in this paper, is proposed. The CLES model allows for a better description of the liquid dispersion within the calculation domain from both qualitative and quantitative points of view when com-pared with the usual LES formalism that does not consider subgrid terms for the interfacial contribution. Mean liquid volume fraction profiles are well captured with CLES when compared to  a posteriori  DNS simulations, and only a weak grid dependency is observed. Grid dependency is generally a major drawback when carrying out LES of interfacial flows. The surface density and behavior are well estimated and de-scribed by using a dedicated transport equation. Based on this parameter and thanks to a good estimation of the critical Weber number value, relevant characteristic scales of the subgrid spray in the atomization regime can be obtained.},

This is a first attempt using MMC-LES to model flows where multi-modes of combustion may occur. The studied burner has two concentric tubes surrounded by an annular pilot. The central tube carrying methane can slide within the outer air tube to induce compositional inhomogeneity at the burner exit plane. This leads to enhanced flame stability at some optimal inner fuel tube recess distance. For comparison purposes, model results are presented firstly for a case with compositional homogeneity at the inlet plane and secondly for the inhomogeneous case. The MMC-LES model shows a very good agreement with the experiment for the homogeneous-inlet case where the prevalence of non-premixed combustion is observed. The inhomogeneous-inlet case features a transition from a premixed flame structure close to the burner to a diffusion flame further downstream. It represents an extreme test of the chosen MMC model which incorporates the enforcement of mixing locally in an extended space comprised of the LES reference mixture fraction and physical location. The computed results show a fair agreement with the data close to the nozzle; closely approaching but not quite achieving the premixed structure. The return to a broad, distributed diffusion flame away from the nozzle is, however, captured very well.},

  abstract = {A mixture fraction is carefully defined for evaporation and combustion of droplets and sprays. The definition is valid at points in either the liquid or gas phases and care is taken to distinguish between definitions based on conserved scalars appropriate for heat transfer and those for mass transfer. Results are presented for Spalding B numbers and values of the mixture fraction at the droplet surface for the fast chemistry case and for the case where the droplet cannot sustain an envelope flame. The classical theory for an isolated droplet with spherical symmetry yields simple formulae when expressed in mixture fraction terms. New results are then readily obtained for several quantities of interest in spray modeling. The formulation provides a seamless unification of droplet evaporation processes with gas-phase mixing and reaction. Mixing in a turbulent spray jet is identified as a model problem that clarifies the role of large scale structures in the overall mixing process. Important constraints on the parameter space for sprays are shown to be greatly clarified when expressed in the mixture fraction framework. It is shown how the classical approach for segregated flow with Eulerian/Lagrangian modeling of dispersion and transfer processes in turbulent sprays can be upgraded to include fluctuations in the temperature and composition surrounding the droplets on top of those coming from the turbulent velocity fluctuations. Such preliminary calculations that assume a simple chemically reacting system can readily be upgraded using flamelet functions derived from counterflow experiments or computations: these can then form the starting point for full chemistry calculations using such approaches as conditional moment closure. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

  abstract = {The present paper reports on the numerical investigation of lifted turbulent jet flames with H 2 /N 2 fuel issuing into a vitiated coflow of lean combustion products of H 2 /air using conditional moment closure method (CMC). A 2D axisymmetric formulation has been used for the predictions of fluid flow, while CMC equations are solved with detailed chemistry to represent the turbulence–chemistry interaction. Simulations are carried out for different coflow temperatures, jet and coflow velocities in order to investigate the impact on the flame lift-off height as well as on the flame stabilization. Furthermore, the role of conditional velocity models on the flame has also been investigated. In addition, the effect of mixing is investigated over a range of coflow temperatures and the stabilization mechanism is determined from the analysis of the transport budgets. It is found that the lift-off height is highly sensitive to the coflow temperature, while the predicted lift-off height using the mixing model constant, i.e., C $\Phi$ = 4, is found to be the closest to the experimental results. For all the coflow temperatures, the balance is found between the chemical, axial convection and molecular diffusion terms while the contribution from axial and radial diffusion is negligible, thus indicating auto-ignition as the flame stabilization mechanism.},

The objective is to provide new insight on turbulent spray flame complex structures similar to those encountered in industrial combustors by joint experimental and numerical diagnostics. Experimental measurements include PDA for air velocity and droplet size as well as velocity and OH-PLIF images for the flame analysis. Numerical simulations consist in Large Eddy Simulation (LES) coupled to Discrete Particle Simulation for the dispersed phase. The comparison between experiment and simulation confirms the capability of LES to reproduce the gaseous and liquid flow structure in both non-reacting and reacting cases with good accuracy. The lifted stabilized spray flame exhibits a complex shape due to interactions between turbulence, chemistry and evaporation. A detailed analysis shows that both partially-premixed and diffusion flames are present, depending on the capacity of droplets to evaporate. Furthermore, an attempt is made to identify the processes leading to two-phase flame stabilization.},

  abstract = {Detailed numerical investigations of the Sydney spray flame series [1] are presented for ethanol flames referred to as EtF3, EtF6 and EtF8, which feature identical ethanol mass flow rates but different carrier gas mass flow rates. Large eddy simulations (LES) are performed, where the gaseous and liquid phases are modeled by an Eulerian/Lagrangian approach. The turbulent sub-filter stresses (sgs) are modeled with Nicoud's sigma model [2] on grids with two different resolutions. Combustion is modeled with the premixed flamelet generated manifold approach (PFGM), which is combined with the artificially thickened flame (ATF) method. The sub-filter distributions of the control variables are modeled with (a) a $\beta$ function ($\beta$-fdf) and (b) a top-hat function (TH). First, the influence of the variance in the mixture fraction and reaction progress variable is investigated separately, where the variances are either determined from an algebraic model or a transport equation model. Subsequently, the TH model is used to account for the joint impact of Z and Yp. The results are compared against the experimental measurements and reference simulations without sub-filter model. The particle statistics are in good agreement with the experimental data. The variances predicted by the two algebraic models are quite similar, whereas the transport equation model predicts variances which are one order of magnitude higher. The results obtained with the TH and the $\beta$-fdf model are comparable. It is found that the impact of the sgs models for the mixture fraction and the progress variable increases with an increasing carrier gas mass flow rate.},

@article{Haworth2010,
  abstract = {Probability density function (PDF) methods offer compelling advantages for modeling chemically reacting turbulent flows. In particular, they provide an elegant and effective resolution to the closure problems that arise from averaging or filtering the highly nonlinear chemical source terms, and terms that correspond to other one-point physical processes (e.g., radiative emission) in the instantaneous governing equations. This review is limited to transported PDF methods, where one models and solves an equation that governs the evolution of the one-point, one-time PDF for a set of variables that determines the local thermochemical and/or hydrodynamic state of a reacting system. Progress over the previous 20-25 years (roughly since Pope's seminal paper [24]) is covered, with emphasis on developments over the past decade. For clarity and concreteness, two current mainstream approaches are adopted as baselines: composition PDF and velocity-composition PDF methods for low-Mach-number reacting ideal-gas mixtures, with standard closure models for key physical processes (e.g., mixing models), and consistent hybrid Lagrangian particle/Eulerian mesh numerical solution algorithms. Alternative formulations, other flow regimes, additional physics, advanced models, and alternative solution algorithms are introduced and discussed with respect to these baselines. Important developments that are discussed include velocity-composition-frequency PDF's, PDF-based methods as subfilter-scale models for large-eddy simulation (filtered density function methods), PDF-based modeling of thermal radiation heat transfer and turbulence-radiation interactions, PDF-based models for soot and liquid fuel sprays, and Eulerian field methods for solving modeled PDF transport equations. Examples of applications to canonical systems, laboratory-scale flames, and practical combustion devices are provided to emphasize key points. An attempt has been made throughout to strike a balance between rigor and accessibility, between breadth and depth of coverage, and between fundamental physics and practical relevance. It is hoped that this review will contribute to broadening the accessibility of PDF methods and to dispelling misconceptions about PDF methods. Although PDF methods have been applied primarily to reacting ideal-gas mixtures using single-turbulence-scale models, multiple-physics, multiple-scale information is readily incorporated. And while most applications to date have been to laboratory-scale nonpremixed flames, PDF methods can be, and have been, applied to high-Damk{\"{o}}hler-number systems as well as to low-to-moderate-Damk{\"{o}}hler-number systems, to premixed systems as well as to nonpremixed and partially premixed systems, and to practical combustion devices as well as to laboratory-scale flames. It is anticipated that PDF-based methods will be adopted even more broadly through the 21st century to address important combustion-related energy and environmental issues. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Celik2005a,
  abstract = {In the light of rapidly increasing applications of large-eddy simulations (LES), it is deemed necessary to impose some quality assessment measures for such studies. The verification of LES calculations is difficult because of the fact that both the subgrid scale (SGS) model contribution and numerical discretization errors are functions of the grid resolution. In this study, various indexes of quality measures, hereafter referred to as LES{\_}IQ, are proposed. The recommended LES{\_}IQ is based on the Richardson extrapolation concept. This method has been applied to various cases and the calculated LES{\_}IQ results are compared with the relative total experimental and direct numerical simulation (DNS) error, defined as IQ{\_}EX and IQ{\_}DNS, respectively. It is postulated that in practical applications of LES, numerical dissipation will always be a significant part of the overall dissipation, and it must be accounted for in any assessment of the quality of LES. It is further suggested that LES{\_}IQ of 75{\%} to 85{\%} can be considered adequate for most engineering applications that typically occur at high Reynolds numbers; the proposed index is an indicator of good resolution (i.e., verification), but not necessarily a good or accurate model (i.e., validation).

These processes are of importance in various applications such as gas turbine ignition (relight) and safety related to flammable liquid mists. The review focuses on the initial kernel development, the evolution of a spherical or edge flame, and the ignition of the spray flame when viewed at the whole combustor scale. The factors that determine success or failure of the ignition process at the various phases of the overall burner ignition are discussed through experiments and Direct Numerical Simulations, while modelling efforts are also assessed. The fuel volatility, droplet size, overall fuel-to-air ratio, and the degree of pre-evaporation are the important factors that distinguish spray ignition from gaseous flame ignition, and the extra fluctuations introduced by the random droplet locations, and how this may affect modelling and flame evolution, are highlighted. The flame propagation mechanism in laminar and turbulent sprays is one of the key aspects determining overall ignition success. Suggestions for future research are discussed.},

Several of these questions highlight the importance of recognizing the dependence of LES calculations on the artificial parameter delta (i.e. the filter width, or more generally, the turbulence resolution length scale). The principle that LES predictions of turbulence statistics should depend minimally on delta provides an alternative justification for the dynamic procedure.},

  abstract = {This paper presents high-speed (HS) images of OH-PLIF collected at a repetition rate of 10 kHz along the entire length of an n-heptane spray jet flame. The experimental set-up is composed of an annular non-swirled air co-flow that surrounds a central hollow-cone spray injector, leading to a stable flame with well-defined boundary conditions. The experiments include accurate measurements of droplet size (PDA), droplet and carrier phase velocity (PDA) and two-dimensional flame structure (OH-PLIF). The polydisperse spray distribution yields small droplets along the centerline axis while the majority of the mass is situated as big droplets along the spray borders. The flame structure presents a classical shape, with an inner wrinkled partially premixed flame front and an outer diffusion flame front. Although the High Speed (HS)-OH-PLIF images are only qualitative, they are found to be a sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to relay the dynamics of extinctions events. Applying data processing tools and coupling with aerodynamics results allowed to highlight different extinctions mechanisms. In the inner reaction zone the measured speed, as well as the turbulent kinetic energy, showed that the large turbulence scales played a significant role in the dynamics of extinction. However; the locally extinction in the outer reaction zone can be attributed to the big droplets that present a skin term for the flame},

The fuel spray is n-heptane, a diesel surrogate and its chemical kinetics are described by a reduced mechanism involving 22 species and 18 reaction steps. The method is applied to a constant volume combustion vessel able to reproduce EGR conditions by the ignition of a hot gas mixture previously introduced into the chamber. Once the prescribed conditions are reached the fuel is then injected. Different EGR conditions in terms of temperature and initial ambient chemical composition are simulated. The results are in good overall agreement with measurements both regarding the ignition delay times and the lift-off heights.},

@article{Xie2019,
  abstract = {When the dual-Lagrangian formulation is employed for simulating dilute spray flames, the subtle mass and energy coupling between the gas and liquid phases could potentially lead to issues such as unrealistic low gas phase particle temperature, numerical instability and grid convergence not ensured. In this study, an exponential distribution (ExpD) scheme is formulated for the non-local distribution of mass and energy source terms from droplet evaporation to adjacent cells, in which the sources are distributed following exponential decay with respect to the distance between the droplet and the cell centre and therefore the mass and energy sources of a computational cell may have contribution from the evaporation of non-local droplets in the domain. Furthermore, a two-step procedure is proposed to avoid unrealistic low temperatures for gas phase particles, in which energy source from evaporation is first applied to all existing gas phase particles in a cell, followed by a substep that handles the enthalpy of the fuel vapour being consistent with the mass coupling model employed. The ExpD scheme together with the new energy coupling strategy have been validated in the single droplet evaporation and combustion simulations. For mass coupling, three existing models, i.e. the NEW, EQUAL and SAT model have been investigated in conjunction with the IEM mixing model. Grid convergence test becomes possible with the ExpD and energy coupling scheme, whose robustness is validated with different mass coupling models. Specifically, the EQUAL model approaches second-order accuracy in space, whereas the NEW and SAT models are first-order accurate. For the steady evaporation of methanol droplet in convective flow, with the finest grid, all the mass coupling models converge to the envelop flame as observed in experiment, but fuel is consumed more completely with the EQUAL model since the fuel and oxidiser are relatively well mixed at particle level.},

  abstract = {Open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes provide suitable environments for implementation, testing and rapid dissemination of algorithms typically used for large-eddy simulations (LES) and direct numerical simulations (DNS). In particular, it is important to test low-dissipative algorithms in unstructured codes of industrial relevance. In the present paper, the implementation of incompressible, explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) based projection methods into the OpenFOAM{\textregistered} library is discussed. We search for low-dissipative alternatives to the second order time integration methods which are commonly used together with the standard pressure correction approach PISO (Pressure Implicit with Splitting of Operators) in many commercial and open source codes including OpenFOAM{\textregistered}. The practical implementation of the projection methods in OpenFOAM{\textregistered} is provided together with theory. The method is tested with the classical fourth order RK-method and the accelerated third order RK-method. Four numerical experiments are carried out in order to cross-validate the solvers and in order to investigate the drawbacks/benefits of the solution approaches. The test problems are: (1) 2d lid driven cavity flow at Re=2500, (2) DNS of 3d turbulent channel flow at Re?=180, (3) LES of a 3d mixing layer, and (4) the 2d inviscid Taylor-Green vortex. The RK-methods are benchmarked against the standard OpenFOAM{\textregistered} LES/DNS solver based on the PISO pressure correction method. The results indicate that the RK projection methods provide low-dissipative alternatives to the PISO method. The turbulent test cases show also that the RK-methods have a good computational efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Celik2005,
  abstract = {In the light of rapidly increasing applications of large-eddy simulations (LES), it is deemed necessary to impose some quality assessment measures for such studies. The verification of LES calculations is difficult because of the fact that both the subgrid scale (SGS) model contribution and numerical discretization errors are functions of the grid resolution. In this study, various indexes of quality measures, hereafter referred to as LES{\_}IQ, are proposed. The recommended LES{\_}IQ is based on the Richardson extrapolation concept. This method has been applied to various cases and the calculated LES{\_}IQ results are compared with the relative total experimental and direct numerical simulation (DNS) error, defined as IQ{\_}EX and IQ{\_}DNS, respectively. It is postulated that in practical applications of LES, numerical dissipation will always be a significant part of the overall dissipation, and it must be accounted for in any assessment of the quality of LES. It is further suggested that LES{\_}IQ of 75{\%} to 85{\%} can be considered adequate for most engineering applications that typically occur at high Reynolds numbers; the proposed index is an indicator of good resolution (i.e., verification), but not necessarily a good or accurate model (i.e., validation).

@article{Gordon2007,
  abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study of auto-ignition in simple jets of a hydrogen-nitrogen mixture issuing into a vitiated co-flowing stream. The stabilization region of these flames is complex and, depending on the flow conditions, may undergo a transition from auto-ignition to premixed flame propagation. The objective of this paper is to develop numerical indicators for identifying such behavior, first in well-known simple test cases and then in the lifted turbulent flames. The calculations employ a composition probability density function (PDF) approach coupled to the commercial CFD code, FLUENT. The in-situ-adaptive tabulation (ISAT) method is used to implement detailed chemical kinetics. A simple k- turbulence model is used for turbulence along with a low Reynolds number model close to the solid walls of the fuel pipe. The first indicator is based on an analysis of the species transport with respect to the budget of convection, diffusion and chemical reaction terms. This is a powerful tool for investigating aspects of turbulent combustion that would otherwise be prohibitive or impossible to examine experimentally. Reaction balanced by convection with minimal axial diffusion is taken as an indicator of auto-ignition while a diffusive-reactive balance, preceded by a convective-diffusive balanced pre-heat zone, is representative of a premixed flame. The second indicator is the relative location of the onset of creation of certain radical species such as HO2 ahead of the flame zone. The buildup of HO2 prior to the creation of H, O and OH is taken as another indicator of auto-ignition. The paper first confirms the relevance of these indicators with respect to two simple test cases representing clear auto-ignition and premixed flame propagation. Three turbulent lifted flames are then investigated and the presence of auto-ignition is identified. These numerical tools are essential in providing valuable insights into the stabilization behaviour of these flames, and the demarcation between processes of auto-ignition and premixed flame propagation.},

  abstract = {An unsteady flamelet/progress variable (UFPV) model has been developed for the prediction of autoignition in turbulent lifted flames. The model is a consistent extension to the steady flamelet/progress variable (SFPV) approach, and employs an unsteady flamelet formulation to describe the transient evolution of all thermochemical quantities during the flame ignition process. In this UFPV model, all thermochemical quantities are parameterized by mixture fraction, reaction progress parameter, and stoichiometric scalar dissipation rate, eliminating the explicit dependence on a flamelet time scale. An a priori study is performed to analyze critical modeling assumptions that are associated with the population of the flamelet state space.For application to LES, the UFPV model is combined with a presumed PDF closure to account for subgrid contributions of mixture fraction and reaction progress variable. The model was applied in LES of a lifted methane/air flame. Additional calculations were performed to quantify the interaction between turbulence and chemistry a posteriori. Simulation results obtained from these calculations are compared with experimental data. Compared to the SFPV results, the unsteady flamelet/progress variable model captures the autoignition process, and good agreement with measurements is obtained for mixture fraction, temperature, and species mass fractions. From the analysis of scatter data and mixture fraction-conditional results it is shown that the turbulence/chemistry interaction delays the ignition process towards lower values of scalar dissipation rate, and a significantly larger region in the flamelet state space is occupied during the ignition process. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract = {We investigate the multi-flame phenomenon often seen in spray combustion. To do so, simulations are made of two cases from the Delft Spray in Hot Coflow (DSHC) database. These two cases have the same fuel (ethanol) but differ in the type of coflow: room temperature air (case AII) or products of lean premixed combustion (case HII), and they exhibit remarkably different flame structure, respectively with a 'double flame' and a 'single flame'. The two-phase flow was handled with an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with Flamelet Generated Manifolds (FGM) method was used to account for the turbulence and combustion. Validation was done by using available experimental data as well as information on similar systems reported in literature. Major features of these two cases were correctly reproduced. Simulation results revealed that four spatially separated reaction regions exist in the flame AII and two in the flame HII. These regions are of different types, premixed or non-premixed, and are formed by different species, major fuel (ethanol) or intermediate species, e.g. carbon monoxide. The mechanism underlying the multi-flame structure was investigated and explained in terms of the relative magnitude of different time scales, namely of droplet evaporation, dispersion, convection and reaction. Parametric studies on the effect of spray polydispersity and coflowing air temperature were carried out, demonstrating an even wider range of flame structures. An important observation is that the 'single flame' structure usually present in the hot-diluted coflow case (HII), is also generated in a case of room temperature air coflow, provided the injected droplets are small. This is attributed to the fact that representative droplets in all cases with single flame have similar evaporation time scale. Or stated more generally, by matching important time scales, similar flame structure can be created under considerably different conditions.},

Lifted turbulent jet diffusion flames of H2/N2 issued into a hot coflowing stream of combustion products from a lean premixed H2/air mixture are simulated using the stochastic multiple mapping conditioning (MMC) approach within the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) framework. The underlying turbulent flow is modeled using the two-equation k-$\epsilon$ model with modified constants. In the MMC approach, large-scale turbulent fluctuations are emulated by introducing suitable reference variables. A single reference variable is used here to describe the evolution of mixture fraction via a mapping function. The modified Curl's model has been adapted to model the micro-mixing term. A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism involving 9 species and 21 reversible reactions is used for H2/O2 combustion. The computed results from the present simulations are found to be in excellent agreement with the available experimental data. Numerical results are found to be sensitive to change in the minor dissipation timescale, which certainly controls the conditional fluctuations around the conditional mean. Also, the predicted flame lift-off heights obtained using the minor mixing time constant C min = 0.25 are found to be in close proximity with the experimentally observed values for the entire range of coflow temperatures.},

The mapping function approximates the cumulative probability distribution of mixture fraction and the corresponding variance can be controlled by a standard implementation of the scalar mixing time scale. The conditional fluctua- tions are controlled by a minor dissipation time scale, $\tau$ min . The results show a clear dependence of the conditional fluctuations on the choice of the minor time scale, and the appropriate value for turbulent jet flames is similar to values determined in related DNS studies of homogeneous turbulent reacting flows. The predictions of means and variances of temperature and species mass fractions are very good for all flames indicating an appropriate modelling of the conditional vari- ances. Further sensitivity studies with respect to particle number density demonstrate a relative insensitivity of the results to the particle number in the numerical solution procedure. Good results can be obtained with as few as 10 particles per cell allowing for a computationally inexpensive implementation of a Monte-Carlo/PDF method.},

  abstract = {An experimental and numerical investigation is presented of a lifted turbulent H2/N2 jet flame in a coflow of hot, vitiated gases. The vitiated coflow burner emulates the coupling of turbulent mixing and chemical kinetics exemplary of the reacting flow in the recirculation region of advanced combustors. It also simplifies numerical investigation of this coupled problem by removing the complexity of recirculating flow. Scalar measurements are reported for a lifted turbulent jet flame of H2/N2 (Re = 23,600, H/d = 10) in a coflow of hot combustion products from a lean H2/Air flame ($\phi$ = 0.25, T = 1045 K). The combination of Rayleigh scattering, Raman scattering, and laser-induced fluorescence is used to obtain simultaneous measurements of temperature and concentrations of the major species, OH, and NO. The data attest to the success of the experimental design in providing a uniform vitiated coflow throughout the entire test region. Two combustion models (joint scalar probability density function and eddy dissipation concept) are used in conjunction with various turbulence models to predict the liftoff height (HPDF/d = 7, HEDC/d=8.5). Kalghatgi's classic phenomenological theory, which is based on scaling arguments, yields a reasonably accurate prediction (HK/d = 11.4) of the liftoff height for the present flame. The vitiated coflow admits the possibility of autoignition of mixed fluid, and the success of the present parabolic implementation of the PDF model in predicting a stable lifted flame is attributable to such ignition. The measurements indicate a thickened turbulent reaction zone at the flame base. Experimental results and numerical investigations support the plausibility of turbulent premixed flame propagation by small-scale (on the order of the flame thickness) recirculation and mixing of hot products into reactants and subsequent rapid ignition of the mixture.},

  abstract = {Ethanol pressure-swirl sprays issuing in a hot-diluted oxidizer coflow with different temperature and composition were studied. The bulk coflow temperature was varied together with the oxygen volume fraction. The bulk coflow temperature was changed from 1480 K to 1225 K and the oxygen volume fraction from 7.1{\%} to 10.1{\%}. The liquid mass flow rates were chosen to yield spray flames with nearly identical Weber number. Laser Doppler anemometry, phase Doppler anemometry and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering were applied in the spray region and the coflow inlet. The current measurements provide a thorough description of the spray structure, droplet dispersion and gas temperature fields as well as a comprehensive database useful for validation of numerical models. Visual observations of the flame luminescence reveal that the lift-off height depends on the liquid mass flow rates as well as the coflow conditions. The lift-off height is shown to increase for lower coflow temperatures and higher liquid mass flow rates. It is found that lift-off behavior depends on the droplet convective, vaporization and chemical time scales prior to ignition. Phase Doppler anemometry results indicate that the droplet mean size and velocity distribution close to the atomizer are not influenced by the coflow conditions. A flame-front develops at the outer region of the spray where a low density of large droplets are present. A significant number of peak temperatures samples above 2000. K is observed at this location. Decrease of the coflow temperature leads to a reduction of the local peak temperatures. Closer to the center axis, the local mixture composition becomes increasingly rich and the heat-release is lower than in the outer region.},

@article{Mortensen2009,
  abstract = {In this work we derive the fundamental equations for conditional moment closure (CMC) modelling of individual phases set in a two-phase flow. The derivation is based on the instantaneous transport equations for the single phase that involve a level set/indicator function technique for accounting for interfaces. Special emphasis is put on spray combustion with the CMC equations formulated for the gas phase. The CMC equations are to be viewed as an adjunct to existing methods for the modelling of the dynamics of sprays: they provide a refinement of the modelling of chemical reactions in the gas phase. The resulting CMC equations differ significantly from those already in use in the literature. They contain, of course, unclosed terms that need to be modelled. Investigation of the unclosed terms associated with evaporation at the droplet surface is well beyond the capabilities of laboratory measurement or direct numerical simulation. It is proposed that modelling of these terms be based on the well-established 'laws' of similarity between heat and mass transfer: an example is detailed for one example of the general modelling of the spray dynamics. Other unclosed terms are important throughout the gas phase. Models used for these terms in single-phase flows are reviewed and it is proposed that any modifications needed for these models be investigated by DNS of suitable model problems having good resolution of the flow and mixing in the inter-droplet space. It is proposed that a spray analogue of the scalar mixing layer that has been widely studied in single-phase flows be used as the model problem for such DNS studies and also for LES and RANS modelling. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract = {This article presents an overview of the current understanding of the structure of turbulent sprays flames, both dilute and dense. Dilute sprays are addressed first with respect to recent advances in measurement and modeling capabilities. Comprehensive data banks exist for the velocity and droplet fields of such flows while measurements of temperature and reactive scalar fields are sparse and mixture fraction measurements remain a challenge. Computations of turbulent dilute sprays flames are now able to reproduce the main experimental features although details for reactive scalars and droplet interactions with turbulence vary depending on the employed combustion model. In dense sprays, direct measurements in engines can now resolve useful details of the spray patterns and the extent of interactions with walls. However, diagnostic techniques in primary spray atomization zones need to improve significantly to provide sufficient quantitative information about liquid fragmentation rates. Calculations of spray jets in engines largely employ the “blob” approach for the initial spray representation with a range of models for subsequent atomization. Various direct numerical simulations/large eddy simulation approaches are able to compute details of the primary and secondary atomization patterns and the results are employed to develop improved spray atomization models. These advances from turbulent dilute and dense sprays must be brought together to improve overall modeling capabilities in this field.},

  abstract = {Simulations are presented for the engine combustion network (ECN) n-dodecane spray A using the sparse-Lagrangian multiple mapping conditioning model for the reactive scalar field coupled with a large eddy simulation for the flow (MMC-LES). This is the first application of the MMC-LES to both transient and engine conditions and, in line with earlier simulations of the ECN flames, the fuel injection is modelled as a gas-jet. The model is evaluated initially for a baseline non-reacting case with ambient temperature of 900 K. Results for vapour penetration lengths and the radial profiles of mixture fraction show good agreement with experiments. The model is then applied to reacting cases, featuring transient ignition and combustion with a lifted flame base. A 106-species chemistry mechanism is employed. Simulations are performed at various ambient temperatures (800–1100 K) and various volume fractions of ambient oxygen (13–21{\%}) that correspond to conditions in both conventional and advanced diesel engines. The trend towards decreasing ignition delay time and lift-off length with increasing ambient temperature and oxygen is predicted well. The quantitative agreement between the computed and experimental ignition delay times is satisfactory. The accuracy of lift-off length predictions is less accurate but comparable to the existing literature. Better results are obtained at the conditions with lower ambient temperatures and oxygen concentrations. This outcome is explored with a detailed analysis of heat release and scalar dissipation rates under various ambient temperature conditions. It is revealed that at high ambient temperatures, flame stabilisation occurs in a region with significant turbulence–chemistry interactions and close to the nozzle exit where the liquid phase would be expected to influence the flame.},

Models of this type have a free parameter, the dispersion coefficient, which is not universal and is strongly grid-dependent. In the present paper, a dynamic model for the evaluation of the coefficient is proposed and validated in decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The grid dependence of the static coefficient is investigated in a turbulent mixing layer and compared to the dynamic model. The dynamic model accurately predicts dispersion statistics and resolves the grid-dependence. Dispersion statistics of the dynamically calculated constant are more accurate than any static coefficient choice for a number of grid spacings. Furthermore, the dynamic model produces less numerical artefacts than a static model and exhibits smaller sensitivity in the results predicted for different particle relaxation times. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The time required for the sim- ulation to achieve a fully developed flow is determined, as well as an appropriate sampling period for statistics. The immersed boundary condition technique applied to these flames is explained and its short-comings are discussed. The paper shows first and second moments for the velocity components in the non-reactive flow and preliminary mixture fraction results for one flame of the series. Results are in reasonable agreement with experimental data, while some deficiencies show that further grid refinement and more accurate inflow data are needed before the simulation of the entire flame series can be attempted.},

The transport equations for the spatially filtered gas phase variables, in which source terms accounting for the droplet effects are added, are solved together with a probabilistic description of the liquid phase. The probabilistic approach for the liquid phase is based on the transport equation for the spatially filtered joint probability density function of the variables required in order to describe the state of the liquid phase. In this equation, unclosed terms representing the filtered Lagrangian rates of change of the variables describing the spray are present. General modelling ideas for subgrid-scale (SGS) effects are proposed. The capabilities of the approach and the validity of the closure models, with particular with respect to the SGS dispersion, are investigated through application to a dilute particle-laden turbulent mixing layer. It is demonstrated that the formulation is able to reproduce very closely the measured properties of both the continuous and dispersed phases. The large-eddy simulation (LES) results are also found to be entirely consistent with the experimentally observed characteristics of droplet–gas turbulence interactions. Consistent with direct numerical simulation (DNS) studies of isotropic turbulence laden with particles where the entire turbulence spectrum is found to be modulated by the presence of particles, the present investigation, which comprises the effects of particle transport upon the large-scale vortical structures of a turbulent shear flow, highlights what appears to be a selective behaviour; few large-scale frequencies gain energy whereas the remaining modes are damped.},

  abstract = {The joint velocity-turbulence frequency-composition PDF method is applied to a lifted turbulent jet flame with H2/N2 fuel issuing into a wide coflow of lean combustion products, which are at a temperature of 1045 K. Model calculations with detailed chemistry are performed using three existing mixing models (IEM, MC, and EMST) and two chemistry mechanisms (the Mueller and Li mechanisms). Numerically accurate results are obtained and compared with the experimental data. Recent experiments have shown that the stabilization height of this lifted flame is very sensitive to the coflow temperature, much more than to the inlet velocity profile or the initial temperature of the fuel. One percent (i.e., 10 K) change in the coflow temperature (which is well within the experimental uncertainty) can double the lift-off height. The joint PDF calculations capture this sensitivity very well and are in good agreement with the measurements for the velocity, mixture fraction, and species. The three mixing models give relatively similar results, implying that the cases studied here are mainly controlled by chemical kinetics. The Li mechanism results in earlier ignition than the Mueller mechanism and hence gives shorter lift-off heights over the whole test range. The joint PDF calculations generally give better agreement with the measurements than previous composition PDF calculations [A.R. Masri et al., Combust. Theory Modelling 8 (2004) 1–22]. A new parallel algorithm, involving domain partitioning of particles, has been implemented to facilitate these computations.},

Spray evaporation is included in the flamelet model through the pre-calculation of counterflowing laminar spray flames with a detailed reaction mechanism of 38 species and 337 elementary reactions for ethanol/air combustion. A transport equation for the mean scalar dissipation rate of the mixture fraction is derived, taking into account the spray evaporation. The computed results are compared with the experimental data provided by A. Masri, University of Sydney, Australia. All major spray flame characteristics, including the Sauter mean diameter, the droplet velocity, and its turbulent fluctuations as well as gas temperature, generally show good agreement with experiments. Different models for the scalar dissipation rate of the mixture fraction are not significantly different for the flame under consideration except for inside the chemical reaction zone, where the new model shows some improvement compared to the experiment.},

  abstract = {A sparse particle implementation of the multiple mapping conditioning / large eddy simulation (MMC-LES) model is assessed against direct numerical simulations (DNS) of non-premixed syngas combustion in the double shear layer configuration of Hawkes et al. (2007). The considered configuration features strong extinction and reignition and therefore poses a stringent test of the model's capabilities to capture finite-rate chemistry effects. The investigation focuses on the modelling of the Lagrangian mixing time scale, $\tau$L, which emulates the dissipation of conditional subfilter scalar fluctuations. An a posteriori strategy is used to separate LES errors from potential shortcomings in modelling of $\tau$L. The DNS data are filtered on the LES grid to compute all LES-filtered quantities that are needed for the modelling of $\tau$L while the (unfiltered) DNS velocity and mixture fraction fields are used for particle transport and mixing model localization, respectively. The results show that the previously derived and most commonly used model for $\tau$L (Cleary {\&} Klimenko, 2011) is capable of accurately capturing the temporal evolution of the mean quantities in the flame and that, by virtue of the controlled localisation of the generalised MMC mixing model in a reference mixture fraction space, statistical predictions are quite insensitive to variations in the spatial distance between particles. However, the model yields significant under-predictions of the conditional variances of the reactive scalars, both for the reference case and an additional case with a reduced reaction zone thickness. It is shown that for these particular flames the conditional variance under-predictions cannot be completely remedied by tuning the input parameter fm which determines the amount of mixing localisation in reference mixture fraction space. Instead, this shortcoming is attributed to the model for $\tau$L. Alternative model closures are suggested which are based on a consistent anisotropic or isotropic perspective on subfilter scalar mixing in sparse particle schemes. The anisotropic closure is demonstrated to significantly improve the model predictions, in particular for the conditional scalar variances. Additionally the predictions show less sensitivity to variations in fm providing good potential for improved robustness of sparse particle methods for MMC-LES. A series of tests involving a three order of magnitude increase in particle number is conducted to demonstrate numerical convergence. During those tests the two primary model parameters, fm and rm which control the mixing distance between particles in both mixture fraction space and physical space, are held constant so that those mixing distances are independent of the number of particles used and, at the same time, the sparse character of the mixing model is preserved.},

  abstract = {AbstractThis paper presents a detailed sensitivity analysis of the sparse-Lagrangian multiple mapping conditioning (MMC) model to different parameters in simulations of n-dodecane flame A which is adopted by the engine combustion network (ECN). The model is fully coupled with a large eddy simulation (LES) approach. A gas-jet model is used for the fuel injection. The MMC-LES model is first examined for a non-reacting case and the sensitivity of the results to variations in the inlet turbulence intensity are examined. It is found that the mixture fraction profiles agree well with the experimental data. The vapour penetration is overpredicted but there is significant improvement by increasing the turbulence intensity of the inlet jet from 10{\%} to 15{\%}. The model sensitivities to inlet turbulence intensity, mixing model parameters and chemical kinetics is then investigated for reacting cases. Simulations are performed at various levels of ambient oxygen (13{\%} - 21{\%}). The turbulence intensity effects on the computed ignition delay times are insignificant while it is found that lower inlet turbulence improves the lift-off lengths. The MMC-LES relies on a mixing localness parameter, fm, with lower values enforcing greater localness in mixture fraction space. Three different values are tested here. A lower fm provides a better prediction of the ignition delay times while the effects on lift-off lengths are not significant. Both 106-species and 54-species kinetics mechanisms are used. The results reveal a strong influence of the chemistry model with the 54-species scheme leading to significant improvements in both the ignition delay times and lift-off lengths.},

@article{Meneveau1996,
  abstract = {The dynamic model for large-eddy simulation of turbulence samples information from the resolved velocity field in order to optimize subgrid-scale model coefficients. When the method is used in conjunction with the Smagorinsky eddy-viscosity model, and the sampling process is formulated in a spatially local fashion, the resulting coefficient field is highly variable and contains a significant fraction of negative values. Negative eddy viscosity leads to computational instability and as a result the model is always augmented with a stabilization mechanism. In most applications the model is stabilized by averaging the relevant equations over directions of statistical homogeneity. While this approach is effective, and is consistent with the statistical basis underlying the eddy-viscosity model, it is not applicable to complex-geometry inhomogeneous flows. Existing local formulations, intended for inhomogeneous flows, are most commonly stabilized by artificially constraining the coefficient to be positive. In this paper we introduce a new dynamic model formulation, that combines advantages of the statistical and local approaches. We propose to accumulate the required averages over flow pathlines rather than over directions of statistical homogeneity. This procedure allows the application of the dynamic model with averaging to in-homogeneous flows in complex geometries. We analyse direct numerical simulation data to document the effects of such averaging on the Smagorinsky coefficient. The characteristic Lagrangian time scale over which the averaging is performed is chosen based on measurements of the relevant Lagrangian autocorrelation functions, and on the requirement that the model be purely dissipative, guaranteeing numerical stability when coupled with the Smagorinsky model. The formulation is tested in forced and decaying isotropic turbulence and in fully developed and transitional channel flow. In homogeneous flows, the results are similar to those of the volume-averaged dynamic model, while in channel flow, the predictions are slightly superior to those of the spatially (planar) averaged dynamic model. The relationship between the model and vortical structures in isotropic turbulence, as well as ejection events in channel flow, is investigated. Computational overhead is kept small (about 10{\%} above the CPU requirements of the spatially averaged dynamic model) by using an approximate scheme to advance the Lagrangian tracking through first-order Euler time integration and linear interpolation in space.},

  abstract = {The main objective of this work is the modeling of diesel sprays under engine conditions, including the atomization, transport and evaporation processes pivotal in the diesel spray formation and its development. For this purpose, an Eulerian single uid model, embedded in a RANS environment, is implemented in the CFD platform OpenFOAM. The modeling approach implemented here is based on the -Y model. The model is founded on the assumption of ow scales separation. In actual injection systems, it can be assumed that the ow exiting the nozzle is operating at large Reynolds and Weber numbers and thus, it is possible to assume a separation of features such as mass transport (large scales) from the atomization process occurring at smaller scales. The liquid/gas mixture is treated as a pseudo- uid with variable density and which ows with a single velocity eld. Moreover, the mean geometry of the liquid structures can be characterized by modeling the mean surface area of the liquid-gas interphase per unit of volume. Additionally, an evaporation model has been developed around the particular characteristics of the current engine technologies. This means that vaporization process is limited by fuel-air mixing rate and fuel droplets evaporate as long as there is enough air for them to heat up and vaporize. Consequently, the evaporation model is based on the Locally Homogeneous Flow (LHF) approach. Under the assumption of an adiabatic mixing, in the liquid/vapor region, the spray is supposed to have a trend towards adiabatic saturation conditions and to determine this equilibrium between phases Raoult's ideal law is considered. Finally, the spray model is coupled with an advanced combustion model based on approximated di usion ames (ADF), which reduces the computational e ort especially for complex fuels and is a natural step for modeling diesel sprays. First, the model is applied to a basic external ow case under non-vaporizing conditions, extremely convenient due to both the experimental database available and the symmetric layout which allows important simpli cation of the modeling e ort. Good agreement between computational results and experimental data is observed, which encourages its application to a more complex con guration. Secondly, the model is applied to the $\backslash$Spray A from the Engine Combustion Network (ECN), under non-vaporizing conditions, in order to reproduce the internal structure of diesel sprays as well as to produce accurate predictions of SMD droplets sizes. Finally, vaporizing $\backslash$Spray A studies are conducted together with the baseline reacting condition of this database. The calculated spray penetration, liquid length, spray velocities, ignition delay and lift-o length are compared with experimental data and analysed in detail.},

  abstract = {A sparse-Lagrangian multiple mapping conditioning (MMC) model for turbulent diffusion flames is presented and tested against experimental data for a piloted methane/air jet diffusion flame (Sandia Flame D). The model incorporates a large eddy simulation for the flow field and a stochastic multiple mapping conditioning (MMC) approach for the reactive scalars. The stochastic MMC models the filtered density function of the scalar composition field. The numerical implementation involves a sparse-Lagrangian particle scheme in which there are fewer particles than there are LES grid cells. Predictions of similar accuracy to previously published Flame D simulations are achieved using only 35,000 particles (of these only 10,000 are chemically active). Sub-filter conditional dissipation is modelled by interactions between pairs of particles which are closely located in a reference mixture fraction space interpolated from the underlying EuIerian filtered field. A model is developed for the mixing time-scale which is proportional to the distance between mixing particles. It is shown that the time-scale can be adjusted to achieve good predictions for time-averaged mean and fluctuating statistics of passive and reactive scalars. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Combustion Institute.

The interaction-by-exchange-with-the-mean (IEM) model that has been developed for gas-phase flows is extended to describe molecular mixing in nonreactive and reactive spray flows. The joint PDF transport equation is solved by a hybrid finite-volume and Lagrangian Monte Carlo method. Standard spray and turbulence models are used to describe the gas phase and the liquid phase. A turbulent methanol/air spray flame is simulated using the present method. Detailed chemistry is implemented through the spray flamelet model. The precalculated spray flamelet library for methanol/air combustion comprises 23 species and 168 elementary reactions. Thus, the model is capable of predicting the formation of radicals and of pollutants. Different values for the model constant C$\phi${\{}symbol{\}}in the IEM model are tested. The numerical results for the gas velocity, the gas temperature, and the mass fraction of methanol vapor are compared with experimental data in the literature. Good agreement with experiment is obtained when C$\phi${\{}symbol{\}}= 2.0. Marginal PDFs of mixture fraction, enthalpy, and gas temperature are presented. The computed PDFs of mixture fraction are compared with the presumed standard $\beta$ function and modified $\beta$ function. The results show that the standard $\beta$ function fails to reproduce bimodal shapes observed in transported PDF computation, while the modified $\beta$ function, fits the computed PDFs very well. Moreover, joint PDFs of mixture fraction and enthalpy are presented and analyzed. The enthalpy and mixture fraction are strongly correlated. The samples that deviate from the linear correlation are due to the energy consumption of local spray evaporation. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Combustion Institute.},

@article{Ukai2014a,
  abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media 2014.Large-eddy simulations (LES) have been coupled with a conditional moment closure (CMC) method for the computation of a series of turbulent spray flames. An earlier study by Ukai et al. (Proc. Combust. Inst. 34 (1),1643-1650, 2013) gave reasonable results for the prediction of temperature and velocity profiles, but some limitations of the method became apparent. These limitations are primarily related to the upper limit in mixture fraction space. In order to enhance the applicability of the LES-CMC model, this paper proposes a two-conditional moment approach to account for the existence of pre-evaporated fuel by introducing two sets of conditional moments based on different mixture fractions. The two-conditional moment approach is first tested for a non-reacting test case. The results indicate that the spray evaporation induces relatively large conditional fluctuations within a CMC cell, and one set of conditional moments might not be sufficient. The upper limit of the mixture fraction space is dynamically selected for the solution of the second set of conditional moments, and the corresponding CMC solution in a CFD cell is estimated by interpolation between the two conditional moments weighted by the amount of vapour emitted within the domain. The cell-filtered value is given by integration of the conditional moment across mixture fraction space using a bounded $\beta$-FDF for the distribution of the scalar. As a result, the fuel concentration profiles given by LES and the two-conditional moment approach are shown to agree well. Then, the two-conditional moment approach is applied to four different flame configurations. The comparison of LES cell quantities and conditionally averaged moments indicates that the two sets of conditional moments are necessary for accurate predictions in zones where gas phase mixture fraction is significantly increased by droplet evaporation within the computational domain. The unconditional temperature profiles clearly show that the new approach improves the predictions of mean temperature especially along the centerline. Also, the better predictions of the temperature field improve the accuracy of the predicted mean axial droplet velocities. Overall, good agreement with the experimental results is found for all four cases, and the methodology is shown to be applicable to flames with a relatively wide range of fuel vapour concentrations.},

  abstract = {Computational models for combustion must account for complex and inherently interconnected physical processes including dispersion, mixing, chemical reactions, particulate nucleation and growth and, critically, the interactions of these with turbulence. The development of affordable and accurate models that are widely applicable is a work in progress. Stochastic multiple mapping conditioning (MMC) is a fast-emerging approach that has been successfully applied to non-premixed, premixed and partially premixed flames as well to the modelling of liquid and solid particulate synthesis. The method solves the conventional PDF transport equation but incorporates an additional constraint in that the mixing is localised in a reference space. This paper describes the numerical implementation of stochastic MMC in an OpenFOAM compatible code called mmcFoam. The model concepts and equations along with alternative submodels, code structure and numerical schemes are explained. A focus is placed on validation of the computational methods in particular demonstrating numerical convergence and mass consistency of the hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian schemes. Four validation cases are selected including a combustion direct numerical simulation (DNS) case, two combustion experimental jet flame cases and a non-combusting particulate synthesis case. The results show that the total mass and mass distribution of Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes are consistent and confirm that the solutions numerically converge with increasing number of stochastic computational particles and sections for describing particulate size distribution.},

  abstract = {The joint velocity-turbulence frequency-composition PDF method is applied to a lifted turbulent jet flame with H2/N2 fuel issuing into a wide coflow of lean combustion products, which are at a temperature of 1045 K. Model calculations with detailed chemistry are performed using three existing mixing models (IEM, MC, and EMST) and two chemistry mechanisms (the Mueller and Li mechanisms). Numerically accurate results are obtained and compared with the experimental data. Recent experiments have shown that the stabilization height of this lifted flame is very sensitive to the coflow temperature, much more than to the inlet velocity profile or the initial temperature of the fuel. One percent (i.e., 10 K) change in the coflow temperature (which is well within the experimental uncertainty) can double the lift-off height. The joint PDF calculations capture this sensitivity very well and are in good agreement with the measurements for the velocity, mixture fraction, and species. The three mixing models give relatively similar results, implying that the cases studied here are mainly controlled by chemical kinetics. The Li mechanism results in earlier ignition than the Mueller mechanism and hence gives shorter lift-off heights over the whole test range. The joint PDF calculations generally give better agreement with the measurements than previous composition PDF calculations [A.R. Masri et al., Combust. Theory Modelling 8 (2004) 1-22]. A new parallel algorithm, involving domain partitioning of particles, has been implemented to facilitate these computations. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A new mixing model is proposed, which is local in composition space and which seeks to address problems encountered in flows with simultaneous mixing and reaction. In this model the change in particle composition is determined by particle interactions along the edges of a Euclidean minimum spanning tree (EMST) constructed in composition space. Results obtained for the model problem of passive scalars evolving under the influence of a mean scalar gradient in homogeneous turbulence are found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental findings of Sirivat and Warhaft (1983). The model is applied to the diffusion flame test model problem proposed by Norris and Pope (1991) and its performance is found to be superior to that of existing models. The essential feature of the new EMST mixing model, which accounts for its success in the diffusion flame test, is that mixing is modeled locally in composition space.},

  abstract = {In the current work, the jet spray flame reflecting an experimental configuration of a piloted spray burner with a vitiated hot co-flow is modeled using large eddy simulation (LES). We consider a diluted polydisperse spray, which evaporates and diffuses from a fuel-rich spray core, mixes with an oxidizer and eventually auto-ignites. The objective of the present study is to assess an influence of evaporation models and mean droplet diameter on the combustion process in a lifted flame, starting from an auto-ignition up to the flame stabilization. Three evaporation models are involved, i.e., (i) “D2 law”, (ii) infinite conductivity model with Stefan flow effect, and (iii) infinite conductivity non-equilibrium evaporation model based on a Langmuir-Knudsen law. An in-house high-order numerical code was used to carry out the computations. The continuous gas phase is modeled in the Eulerian coordinate system while the spray droplets are tracked in space in the Lagrangian manner. The obtained results show that in a stable combustion regime a flame size and liftoff height only slightly depend on evaporation model. However, in general, it is observed that the spray size can affect the flame structure to a much larger extent. On the other hand, for bigger droplets differences in initial size distribution cause only small flame movement downstream or upstream toward the fuel nozzle. For auto-ignition and initial flame development phase it is observed that both the droplets size and evaporation model affect the obtained results significantly.},

@article{SMAGORINSKY1963,
  abstract = {Abstract An extended period numerical integration of a baroclinic primitive equation model has been made for the simulation and the study of the dynamics of the atmosphere's general circulation. The solution corresponding to external gravitational propagation is filtered by requiring the vertically integrated divergence to vanish identically. The vertical structure permits as dependent variables the horizontal wind at two internal levels and a single temperature, with the static stability entering as a parameter. The incoming radiation is a function of latitude only corresponding to the annual mean, and the outgoing radiation is taken to be a function of the local temperature. With the requirement for thermal equilibrium, the domain mean temperature is specified as a parameter. The role of condensation is taken into account only as it effectively reduces the static stability. All other external sources and sinks of heat are assumed to balance each other locally, and are thus omitted. The kinematics are that of a fluid on a sphere bounded by smooth zonal walls at the equator and at approximately 64° latitude. The dissipative sinks are provided by: (a) surface stresses proportional through a drag coefficient to the square of the surface wind which is suitably extrapolated from above, (b) internal convective stresses proportional to the vertical wind shear, and (c) lateral diffusion of momentum and heat through an exchange coefficient which depends on the local horizontal rate of strain?a horizontal length scale entering as the governing parameter. For a given specification of the parameters, an integration for 60 days has been made from initial conditions where random temperature disturbances have been superimposed on a zonally symmetric regime which is baroclinically unstable according to linear theory. This experiment not only displays the scale selective character of baroclinic instability, yielding zonal wave number 5 to 6, but also predicts an index or energy cycle. The period of this cycle is 11 to 12 days for the first 40 days of the experiment, then lengthening to 17 days while diminishing in amplitude during the latter part. The resulting mean zonal velocity profile is in good qualitative agreement with observation, but too intense, presumably because the effective static stability parameter is taken too large. Furthermore this profile is found to be no more than 5 percent super-geostrophic poleward of the angular momentum maximum and no more than 2 percent sub-geostrophic equatorward. The total zonal angular momentum remains constant to within 2 percent irrespective of the phase of the index cycle. This balance is controlled by the surface wind distribution which agrees quite well with observation. The poleward transport is mainly accomplished by the large-scale eddies, whereas the internal vertical flux is predominantly a transfer of the earth's angular momentum by the meridional circulation. The poleward heat transport is primarily accomplished by a Hadley circulation at low latitudes but by the large-scale horizontal eddies in mid-latitudes, where a Ferrel circulation tends to compensate through an equatorward flux. This compensation at mid-latitudes by an indirect meridional circulation is also quite evident, in the potential-kinetic energy transformations. Comparison of the momentum and heat transfer with observed data when available shows reasonably good quantitative agreement. The lateral transfer of momentum and heat by the non-linear diffusion, which parametrically is supposed to simulate the action of motions of sub-grid scale, accounts for a significant portion of the total eddy transfer. Although no direct comparison with the corresponding transfer in the real atmosphere is available, intuitively our small-scale diffusion appears to play too large a role. A diagnosis is made of the transformations among the baratropic and baroclinic parts of the kinetic energy as well as the zonal mean and zonal perturbation parts of the available potential and kinetic energy. This reveals the dominant paths that the energy passes through from source to ultimate sinks and the processes responsible for these transformations. It is found that the partitioning of dissipation by the energy components may differ considerably from estimates made from observation.},

  abstract = {An Eulerian-Lagrangian spray and atomization (ELSA) model for high-pressure diesel sprays has been developed in this study. The new model is based on the assumption that the high-pressure diesel spray and atomization process can be described by considering a single effective phase of liquid-gas mixture to represent the turbulent mixing of a liquid jet with ambient gases. A switch from the Eulerian approach to the Lagrangian approach is made beyond the dense spray region near the nozzle. It has long been recognized that the standard k − $\epsilon$ turbulence model underpredicts the penetration and overpredicts the spreading rate of high-speed free jets. To correct for these effects, several previously proposed techniques are used to correct for vortex stretching and compressibility effects in high-speed free jets in this study. The turbulence model modifications were applied to high-speed gas and liquid jets, and incorporated into the ELSA model to simulate the high-speed diesel spray and atomization process.},

  abstract = {A comparison between the $\Sigma$-$\gamma$ atomization model and a classical DDM approach has been carried out for diesel spray computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The $\Sigma$-$\gamma$ model, originally proposed by Vallet and Borghi, is based on a Eulerian representation of the spray atomization and dispersion by means of a single-fluid variable density turbulent flow. The locally homogeneous flow approach has been applied to develop a spray vaporization model based on state relationships. A finite-volume solver for model equations has been created using the OpenFOAM CFD open-source C++ library. In the case of the Lagrangian-discrete droplet method (DDM) approach, the original diesel Foam solver of OpenFOAM is used. Model predictions have been compared to experimental measurements of free diesel sprays under vaporizing conditions from the database of the Engine Combustion Network (ECN). Accurate predictions of liquid and vapor spray penetration, as well as mixture fraction, can be achieved for the nominal condition with both models, although DDM simulations tend to be less accurate. Additionally, the near nozzle flow structure of the Spray A condition of ECN is also studied with both models. The conclusion is a more accurate prediction of the near-field internal structure of the spray in the case of the Eulerian model, due to both a higher mesh resolution and a more adequate modeling approach. Consequently, results shown in this work put in evidence the benefits of using a Eulerian model to predict qualitatively and accurately the diesel spray behavior under different ambient conditions and injection pressures. {\textcopyright}2016 by Begell House, Inc.},

  abstract = {An n-dodecane spray flame (Spray A from Engine Combustion Network) was simulated using a $\delta$ function combustion model along with a dynamic structure large eddy simulation (LES) model to evaluate its performance at engine-relevant conditions and to understand the transient behavior of this turbulent flame. The liquid spray was treated with a traditional Lagrangian method and the gas-phase reaction was modeled using a $\delta$ function combustion model. A 103-species skeletal mechanism was used for the n-dodecane chemical kinetic model. Significantly different flame structures and ignition processes are observed for the LES compared to those of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) predictions. The LES data suggests that the first ignition initiates in a lean mixture and propagates to a rich mixture, and the main ignition happens in the rich mixture, preferably less than 0.14 in mixture fraction space. LES was observed to have multiple ignition spots in the mixing layer simultaneously while the main ignition initiates in a clearly asymmetric fashion. The temporal flame development also indicates the flame stabilization mechanism is auto-ignition controlled. Soot predictions by LES present much better agreement with experiments compared to RANS, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Multiple realizations for LES were performed to understand the realization to realization variation and to establish best practices for ensemble-averaging diesel spray flames. The relevance index analysis suggests that an average of 5 and 6 realizations can reach 99{\%} of similarity to the target average of 16 realizations on the mixture fraction and temperature fields, respectively. However, more realizations are necessary for the hydroxide (OH) and soot mass fractions due to their high fluctuations.},

Two-dimensional simulations have been performed during the study, which is in fact enough to capture some of the main features of the spray, such as the spray penetration and the axial velocity. A mesh independence study has also been carried out in order to characterize the lowest mesh size that can be used to correctly characterize the spray. Furthermore, the two-equation k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model has been adjusted by changing some of the parameters of the dissipation rate transport equation in order to accurately characterize the spray.

@article{Cleary2009a,
  abstract = {This paper follows the evolution in understanding of the multiple mapping conditioning (MMC) approach for turbulent combustion and reviews different implementations of MMC models. As the MMC name suggests, the original version represents a consistent combination of CMC-type conditional equations (conditional moment closure) and generalised mapping closure. It seems that the strength of the MMC model, and especially that of its stochastic version, lies in a more general (and much more transparent) interpretation. In this new generalised interpretation, we can replace complicated derivations by physical reasoning and the model appears to be a natural extension of modelling approaches developed in recent decades. MMC can be seen as a methodology for enforcing certain known characteristics of turbulence on a conventional mixing model. This is achieved by localising the mixing operation in a reference space. The reference space variables are selected to emulate the properties of a turbulent flow which have a strong effect on reactive quantities. The best and simplest example is an MMC model which has a single reference variable emulating the mixture fraction. In diffusion flames turbulent fluctuations of reacting quantities are strongly correlated with fluctuations of the mixture fraction. By making mixing local in the reference mixture fraction space a CMC-type mixing closure is enforced. In the original interpretation of MMC the reference variables are modelled as Markov processes. Since the reference variables should emulate properties of turbulent flows as realistically as possible the next step, and the basis of generalised MMC, is to remove the Markovian restriction and set reference variables equal to traced Lagrangian quantities within DNS or LES flow fields. Indeed, no Markov value can emulate the mixture fraction better than the mixture fraction itself. (Using a Markov vector process of dimension higher than the number of conditioning variables represents a more economical alternative for producing reference variables in generalised MMC.) The generalised MMC approach effectively incorporates the mixture fraction-based models, the PDF methods and LES/DNS techniques into a single methodology with possibility of blending useful features developed previously for conventional models. The generalised approach to MMC stimulates a more flexible understanding of simulations using sparsely placed Lagrangian particles as tools that may provide accurate joint distributions of reactive scalars at relatively low computational cost. The physical reasoning behind the new interpretation of MMC is supported by example computations for a partially premixed methane/air diffusion flame (Sandia Flame� D). The scheme utilises LES for the dynamic field and a sparse-Lagrangian filtered density function method with MMC mixing for the scalar field. Two different particle mixing schemes are tested. Simulations are performed using only 35,000 Lagrangian particles (of these only 10,000 are chemically active) on a single workstation. The relatively low computational cost allows the use of realistic chemical kinetics containing 34 reactive species and 219 reactions.},

Two cases with different Damk{\"{o}}hler numbers (Da) are considered. The low Da case (Da-) features extinction followed by reignition while extinction in the high Da case (Da+) is insignificant. The TPDF modelling considers two mixing models: interaction by exchange with the mean (IEM) and Euclidean minimum spanning trees (EMST). Three models for distribution of the evaporation source terms are considered: EQUAL which distributes them in proportion to notional particles' mass weight, NEW which creates new particles of pure fuel, and SAT which distributes the sources preferentially to notional particles close to saturation. It is found that the IEM model overpredicts the extinction when used with any evaporation model for both Da- and Da+ cases. The EMST model captures well the trend for extinction and reignition for the Da- case when it is coupled with the EQUAL evaporation model, but it overpredicts the extinction when coupled with the NEW or SAT evaporation model. For the Da+ case, all evaporation models reasonably capture the flame dynamics when coupled with EMST. The flame temperature in the mixture fraction space was examined to further assess the model performance. In general the EMST model results in narrow PDFs with little conditional fluctuation, while the IEM model produces bimodal PDFs with burning and partial extinction branches.},

  abstract = {In contrast to time-evolving turbulence, direct numerical or large eddy simulations of spatially inhomogeneous flows require turbulent inflow boundary conditions, that make the results strongly influenced by the velocity profiles to be prescribed. This paper aims to present a new approach for generating artificial velocity data which reproduces first and second order one point statistics as well as a locally given autocorrelation function. The method appears to be simple, flexible and more accurate than most of the existing methods. This is demonstrated in two cases. First, direct numerical simulations of planar turbulent jets in the Reynolds number range from 1000 to 6000 are performed. Because of the importance of the primary breakup mechanism of a liquid jet in which inflow influences are evident, the new procedure is secondly used, to study atomization in dependence of the flow inside the nozzle by means of a Volume of Fluid scheme. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

A two-phase flow homogeneous isotropic turbulence was used for the numerical configuration. A statistical analysis of the equilibrium Weber number was performed with a DNS of two-phase flows to verify the definition given by the ELSA model. This verification was carried out for various liquid volume fractions, mesh resolutions, and surface tensions. An ensemble averaging of the time evolution of the interface density was performed to check the validity of the interface density equation used in the ELSA model.

This research area has received much attention during the last two decades, and will continue to grow as LES is applied to an even wider range of flows. It is deceptively difficult to generate inlet turbulence that is appropriate for a specific problem being simulated and various methods have been designed to improve this appropriateness. We present a review of such turbulent inflow boundary conditions, broadly classified into library-based methods, recycling-rescaling-based methods, and synthetic turbulence generators. The last category is given more attention to cover a variety of creative approaches that are found in the literature, as well as due to its practicality. Selection of a particular method for a particular application is a compromise between the required fidelity and the allowable complexity and computational expense. An example case study is presented to illustrate the issues involved in the selection and adaptation process.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations of auto-igniting turbulent lifted jet diffusion flames of CH 4 /air fuel issued into a vitiated coflow of lean combustion products of H 2 /air are performed using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) based stochastic multiple mapping conditioning (MMC) approach. A two-dimensional axisymmetric formulation is used to model the fluid flow, where the gas-phase turbulence terms are closed using the standard two-equation k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model with a modified set of constants. A reduced chemical mechanism ARM2 is used which consists of 19 species and 15 reactions derived from the GRI 3.0 mechanism. In MMC, the concept of mapping function is used, which approximates the cumulative probability distribution of the major scalar, namely mixture fraction for nonpremixed combustion. The corresponding variance of the major scalar is modelled by choosing a standard implementation of the major mixing time scale $\tau$ ϕ modelled in terms of the turbulent time scale as $\tau$ ϕ =$\tau$ t /C ϕ . For all simulations reported herein, the same major mixing time constant C ϕ =3.0 is used. Additionally, in MMC, a minor mixing time scale $\tau$ min is introduced which controls fluctuations of scalars relative to the major fluctuations via the minor mixing time constant, C min . Three different values of C min =($\tau$ min /$\tau$ ϕ )=0.25,0.35and0.50 are used and the corresponding ratios of minor to turbulent time scales are $\tau$ min /$\tau$ t =0.083,0.116 and 0.166, respectively. The conditional and unconditional reactive scalar fields are found to be highly dependent on the choice of C min and hence the ratio of the minor and major mixing time scales. The numerical results are thoroughly validated against the experimental measurements. The variation in lift-off height is found to be in good agreement with the experimental data for the entire range of coflow temperature for C min =0.25. Also, the predicted conditional and unconditional scalar fields from the present RANS-MMC model shows an excellent agreement with the experimental measurements.},

  abstract = {Large Eddy Simulations of dilute spray-air reacting two phase flow are performed following an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The method includes a full two-way coupling in which phase properties and spray source terms are interchanging between the two phases within each coupling time step. To achieve sub-grid scale closures in the filtered equations used for LES of the carrier phase, the Smagorinsky model with dynamic procedure is applied for the flow field while an eddy diffusivity approach is used for the scalar fluxes. The phase transition of droplets is captured using a non-equilibrium evaporation model. The evaporating droplets are tracked using a Langragian procedure. They are injected in a polydisperse manner and generated in time dependent boundary conditions. The combustion is described by a reaction progress variable and a mixture fraction as well as their variances in the line of the Flamelet Generated Manifold method. The ultimate objective of this work is to appraise the ability of this LES-based spray module developed here to retrieve the spray flow and combustion properties of the configuration under study. The configuration consists of a spray jet issued into a pilot flame and a co-flowing atmospheric air in which droplets traverse a pre-evaporation distance and release part of their mass before reaching the combustion zone. Thereby the spray pre-evaporation turns the combustion regime from diffusion to partially premixed. The fuel used is liquid acetone, which is modeled by a detailed reaction mechanism including 84 species and 409 elementary reactions. A series of spray established at different operating conditions are investigated, analyzed and compared. Analysis allows to gain a deep insight into the process ongoing. Comparisons include exhaust gas temperature, droplet velocities and corresponding fluctuations, droplet mean diameters and spray volume flux at different distances from the exit planes. An overall good agreement is reported. {\textcopyright} 2012 The 2Combustion Institute.},

The consistency between the sparse-Lagrangian FDF for the reactive species and the Eulerian large eddy simulation (LES) for velocity along with the accuracy of the reactive species predictions relative to the exact equilibrium solution are presented in detail. The sensitivity to the number of particles used in the simulations, the mixing localization structure, chemistry and numerical time step are all investigated. The analysis shows that consistency between the FDF and LES fields is relatively insensitive to the sparseness of the particle distributions and other model parameters but that the reactive species are strongly dependent on the degree of mixing localization in the LES mixture fraction space. An algorithm is developed to control the localization for any sparse distribution of particles with inter-particle distances within the inertial range, and it is shown that reactive species predictions are sensitive to the mixing distance in a reference mixture fraction space while there is very low sensitivity to the number of particles used in the simulations.

  abstract = {Various characteristics of swirling spray flames of ethanol, n-heptane, n-decane, and n-dodecane have been measured at conditions far from and close to blow-off using phase Doppler anemometry and OH* chemiluminescence, OH-planar laser-induced fluorescence, and Mie scattering at 5?kHz. The blow-off transient has also been examined. The OH* showed that the two main heat release regions lie around the spray jet at the inner recirculation zone and along the outer shear layer between the inner recirculation zone and the annular air jet. The heat release region is shortened and more attached as the flame approached blow-off. Mie images and phase Doppler anemometry data showed a wider dispersion of the ethanol spray compared to the other fuels. Similar spatial distributions of the Sauter mean diameter were observed for the four fuels for identical flow conditions, with the Sauter mean diameter value increasing with decreasing fuel volatility, but with the exception of significant presence of droplets in the nominally hollow cone for the ethanol spray. The OH-planar laser-induced fluorescence measurements showed an intermittent lift-off from the corner of the bluff body and the average lift-off height decreased with increasing air velocity, with less extinction along the inner flame branch especially for the heavier fuels. At the blow-off conditions, local extinctions appeared at both flame branches. The blow-off process followed a gradual reduction of the size of the flame, with the less volatile fuels showing a more severe flame area reduction compared to the condition far from blow-off. The average blow-off duration, $\tau$ext, calculated from the evolution of the area-integrated OH* signal, was a few tens of milliseconds and for all conditions investigated the ratio $\tau$ext /(D/UB) was around 11, but with large scatter. The measurements provide useful information for validation of combustion models focusing on local and global extinction.},

As in the equation for the probability density function of the scalars alone, nonlinear reaction schemes can be treated without approximation. The advantage of considering the joint probability density function equation is that convection (by both the mean and fluctuating velocities) appears in closed form. Consequently, the gradient-diffusion assumption for turbulent transport is avoided. Closure approximations are presented for the terms involving the fluctuating pressure and viscous and diffusive mixing. These models can be expected to be reliable since they are compatible with accurate and proven Reynolds-stress models. The resulting modeled transport equation for the joint probability density function can be solved by the Monte-Carlo method for inhomogeneous flows with complex reactions. {\textcopyright}1981 American Institute of Physics.},

@book{Moukalled2016,
  abstract = {The impetus to write this book came about from three sources: The first source was the bi-yearly computational fluid dynamics (CFD) course, which has been offered over the last 15 years at the American University of Beirut (AUB) by both Drs. Darwish and Moukalled to senior and graduate mechanical engineering students, a course that focuses on the finite volume method (FVM) and CFD applications. The second source grew over the years to become more significant as it was noticed that graduates have started working on increasingly more focused areas and topics in CFD while becoming less cognizant of the general algorithmic expertise that earlier students developed. It became clear that there is a need not only to cover the basis of the numerics at the core of CFD codes but also to discuss the imple mentation issues to ensure thk all students receive a robust understanding of the techniques they are working on. Finally, the collaborative work in advanced numerics with Prof. Dr. Mangani fiom HSLU, Lucerne, Switzerland, which started during the Ph.D. supervision of M. Buchmyer (Ph.D.) from TUGraz, provided all the incentive to clarify and detail much of the numerical basis of the algorithms used in OpenFOAM{\textregistered}. To this end, it was decided that the book would combine a mix of numerical and implementation details allowing the reader, if she/he desires, to fiilly understand and implement a robust and versatile CFD code based on the FVM. This ambitious task was possible only by selecting from the various numerical methods in each of the topics covered in the book a handful set with which the authors are intimately familiar. The result is a book that covers intimately all the topics necessary for the development of a robust CFD code for the simulation of fluid flow at all speeds within the framework of the collocated unstructured finite volume method. The book was also written with the classroom in mind as reflected by the use of copious illustrations; the provision of many exercises covering numerics, pro gramming, and applications; the availability of an academic code (in MATLAB{\textregistered}) that imbeds much of the numerics presented in the book; and finally the various programs and routines in OpenFOAM{\textregistered}.},

  abstract = {The present paper investigates the structure of turbulent spray diffusion flames by means of numerical simulations. The flamelet model for turbulent diffusion flames has recently been extended to turbulent spray diffusion flames. The model is suitable for considering detailed chemical reactions through use of a laminar flame library consisting of structures of laminar gas diffusion flamelets that are characterized by the mixture fraction and its scalar dissipation rate. The focus of the present paper is the implementation of laminar spray diffusion flames for use in turbulent flame computations. Since the structure of laminar spray flames is considerably different from that of their gaseous counterparts, new criteria need to be developed for the implementation of these structures. The present paper presents characteristics of laminar spray flames and their consideration in turbulent flame computations. Both the model predictions (using either laminar gas flames or laminar spray flames) are compared to experimental results of a turbulent, axisymmetric free jet where an air-assisted methanol spray is injected into air. The new model is free of parameters that need to be adjusted to predict experimental data, and it correctly predicts the principal structure of the turbulent spray flame. Two reaction zones are identified where the turbulent model using laminar gas flames needs an artificial cut-off temperature to predict the low temperature regime where liquid is present.

  abstract = {The present vitiated coflow flame consists of a lifted jet flame formed by a fuel jet issuing from a central nozzle into a large coaxial flow of hot combustion products from a lean premixed H2/air flame. The fuel stream consists of CH4 mixed with air. Detailed multiscalar point measurements from combined Raman-Rayleigh-LIF experiments are obtained for a single base-case condition. The experimental data are presented and then compared to numerical results from probability density function (PDF) calculations incorporating various mixing models. The experimental results reveal broadened bimodal distributions of reactive scalars when the probe volume is in the flame stabilization region. The bimodal distribution is attributed to fluctuation of the instantaneous lifted flame position relative to the probe volume. The PDF calculation using the modified Curl mixing model predicts well several but not all features of the instantaneous temperature and composition distributions, time-averaged scalar profiles, and conditional statistics from the multiscalar experiments. A complementary series of parametric experiments is used to determine the sensitivity of flame liftoff height to jet velocity, coflow velocity, and coflow temperature. The liftoff height is found to be approximately linearly related to each parameter within the ranges tested, and it is most sensitive to coflow temperature. The PDF model predictions for the corresponding conditions show that the sensitivity of flame liftoff height to jet velocity and coflow temperature is reasonably captured, while the sensitivity to coflow velocity is underpredicted. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Combustion Institute.

However, each one of them has both advantages and disadvantages in different regions of the spray, it can be the dense zone or the downstream dilute zone. One of the most promising techniques, which has been in development since ten years ago, is the Eulerian-Lagrangian Spray Atomization (ELSA) model.

@article{Ma2016b,
  abstract = {This paper reports a numerical study on the Delft Spray-in-Hot-Coflow (DSHC) flame with a new OpenFOAM solver developed by the authors, in which the Flamelet Generated Manifolds (FGM) model has been implemented, and used to account for the Turbulence-Chemistry Interaction (TCI). The enthalpy loss effect due to droplet vaporization is considered by employing an additional controlling parameter in the FGM library. Different configurations for generating three dimensional non-adiabatic FGM library are tested. Analysis of the DSHC experimental data suggested that flash boiling influences the atomization of liquid fuel in the DSHC burner. This introduces new challenges for specifying precise spray boundary conditions. A conditional injection model is proposed to provide precise spray information at the injector exit plane (Z=0mm). In this conditional injection model, the droplets have an asymmetric distribution around the spray half angle, in agreement with experimental observations. Also, the possible range of droplet injection angle is conditioned upon the droplet size (mass). Droplet initial velocity magnitude is scaled such that it peaks at the spray half angle direction and reaches a minimum at the edge of the spray cloud. The results obtained show that this model significantly improves the prediction of all the properties examined compared to standard injection model. Comparison between Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is made, and it is found that the LES predicted similar gas phase velocity and better temperature profiles compared to experimental data than URANS, mainly due to the better performance of the dynamic model for mixture fraction variance used in LES. The improvement of the temperature prediction by the non-adiabatic FGM was clearly demonstrated by comparing the results obtained with an adiabatic FGM table. Strong droplet–flame interaction was shown to exist in the DSHC flame. Large droplets have ballistic trajectories at the early stage of their lifetime, and can penetrate the flame and survive until far downstream outside the main reaction region. Movement of these large droplets strongly deform the shape of the flame. Rapid evaporation of droplets in the reaction region may also cause local quenching. Small droplets are quickly convected towards the central region and vanish soon, forming a fuel rich and high temperature condition in the center. These phenomena have been captured with the LES/non-adiabatic FGM modeling approach developed in this paper.},

@article{Jenny2012b,
  abstract = {In a real turbulent spray flame, dispersion, continuous phase turbulence modification, dispersed phase inter-particle collisions, evaporation, mixing and combustion occur simultaneously. Dealing with all these complexities and their interactions poses a tremendous modeling task. Therefore, in order to advance current modeling capabilities, it seems reasonable to aim for progress in individual sub-areas like breakup, dispersion, mixing and combustion, which however cannot be viewed in complete isolation. Further, one has to consider advantages and disadvantages of the general modeling approaches, which are direct numerical simulation (DNS), large eddy simulation (LES), simulations based on Reynolds averaged equations and probability density function (PDF) methods. Not least one also has to distinguish between Eulerian and Lagrangian dispersed phase descriptions. The goal of this paper is to provide a review of computational model developments relevant for turbulent dilute spray combustion, i.e. the dense regime, including collisions as well as primary and secondary atomization, is not covered. Also not considered is breakup in dilute sprays, which can occur in the presence of sufficiently high local turbulence. It is intended to guide readers interested in theory, in the development and validation of predictive models, and in planning new experiments. In terms of physical phenomena, the current understanding regarding turbulence modification due to droplets, preferential droplet concentration, impact on evaporation and micro-mixing, and different spray combustion regimes is summarized. In terms of modeling, different sets of equations are discussed, i.e. the governing conservation laws without and with point droplet approximation as employed by DNS, the filtered equations considered in LES, the Reynolds averaged equations, and Lagrangian evolution equations. Further, small scale models required in the context of point droplet approximations are covered. In terms of computational studies and method developments, progress is categorized by the employed approaches, i.e. DNS, LES, simulations based on Reynolds averaged equations, and PDF methods. In terms of experiments, various canonical spray flame configurations are discussed. Moreover, some of the most important experiments in this field are presented in a structured way with the intention to provide a database for model validation and a guideline for future investigations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The comparison with the experiment shows a good quantitative prediction of the velocity field of the gas and the liquid phases, in both non-reacting and reacting cases. Experimental and numerical results of the spray flame are also in good agreement. The detailed study of the interaction between the flame front and the droplets shows that both single droplet and group combustion regimes occur in the present configuration.

  abstract = {This paper presents a study of spray jets and flames where the liquid fuel loading in the carrier air is such that there are substantial liquid-liquid interactions close to the exit plane. The burner consists of an air-blast atomizer located within a wide hot co-flow used to stabilize turbulent auto-igniting spray flames. Laser/phase Doppler anemometry, microscopic backlit imaging coupled with advanced image processing, broadband chemiluminescence and OH-PLIF imaging are utilized. A key focus here is on a novel characterization of the spray boundary condition in terms of non-spherical shapes of fluid fragments. Three different classes of shapes, namely: ligaments, droplets, and large, generally irregular objects are examined. Statistics for each of these fragments are computed in a range of sprays and it is found that their size and probability of occurence depends on the initial Weber number and fuel/air mass ratio (. F/. A). The change in chemiluminescence emission that is measured as a function of the F/. A ratio trends in the same manner as the change in the size of the largest non-spherical objects in the spray. In addition, it is found that changes in the growth of reaction zone width occur as estimated from OH images of laser induced fluorescence, and this is also controlled by the F/. A ratio. Therefore, the spray structure at the exit plane may partly dictate the downstream flame characteristics; and this could be largely due to the presence of non-spherical fragments and hence the different rates of atomization and vapourization amongst the different sprays. The burner, as well as the classification of the spray introduced here, while complex, can form a platform for the improvement of models for moderately dense reacting sprays.},

Experimental axial velocity profiles in different sections of the spray showed a radial distribution that was fitted with a high level of agreement to a Gaussian profile and so proving that this type of profile is a reasonable approach for the type of sprays within the scope of the present work.

Basic properties of the model have been studied using Taylor-Green vortex flows. By preserving the almost exact spatial locality, the local dynamic one-equation model predicts the turbulent flow field more accurately than the other models tested. In addition, this model has proven to be efficient with lower computational cost than the locally averaged DKSGS model.

  abstract = {Generating effective and efficient inlet boundary conditions for large eddy simulation (LES) is a challenging problem. The most accurate way of achieving this is to run a precursor calculation to generate a library of turbulence, either prior to the simulation or concurrently with it, and to transfer the data from the library simulation to the main domain inlet. In this paper, we investigate a variant of this, in which the precursor calculation is subsumed into the main domain, its function being adopted by a mapping of data from a specified plane downstream of the inlet back to the inlet. Within this inlet section of the main domain, the flow can be affected by a number of computational manipulations, including the introduction of artificial body forces, modification of the mapped data, and direct correction of the velocity data. These modifications can be linked to feedback control algorithms to drive the solution towards specified characteristics, including mean and turbulent flow profiles, and bulk properties of the flow such as swirl. Various variants of the basic technique incorporating different levels of complexity in the control are implemented and tested on simulation of flow in a rectangular channel and in a circular pipe. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

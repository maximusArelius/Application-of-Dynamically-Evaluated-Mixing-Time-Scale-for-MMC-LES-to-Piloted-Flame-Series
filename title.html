<div>Assessment of Dynamically Evaluated Mixing Time-Scales for MMC-LESThe report contains the predictions of Sandia piloted flames D-F with the dynamically evaluated minor mixing time scale model. The objective of the study is to eliminate the need to specify any static constants to calculate the scalar mixing time scale. The effect of the variation is studied for a piloted Methane flame series with varying levels of local extinction. The time scales, evaluated in three different manner, do not show much sensitivity to the results for the relatively stable flame D, while significant variation is seen for flame F.</div>
